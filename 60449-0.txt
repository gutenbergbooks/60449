PREFACE.


The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly depend
upon the zeal and ardour by which all who enter into its service
are animated, and consequently it is of the highest importance that
any measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation, by which
alone great and gallant actions are achieved, should be adopted.

Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this desirable
object than a full display of the noble deeds with which the
Military History of our country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those who have
preceded him in their honorable career, are among the motives that
have given rise to the present publication.

The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced in the
“London Gazette,” from whence they are transferred into the public
prints: the achievements of our armies are thus made known at the
time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute of praise and
admiration to which they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions,
the Houses of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on
the Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under their
orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for their skill
and bravery; and these testimonials, confirmed by the high honour
of their Sovereign’s approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.

It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental armies)
for British Regiments to keep regular records of their services
and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been experienced in
obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.

This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His Majesty
having been pleased to command that every Regiment shall, in
future, keep a full and ample record of its services at home and
abroad.

From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations which
chequer the career of those who embrace the military profession. In
Great Britain, where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and
where these pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed
by the _presence of war_, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active service
and of the casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the
British Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little
or no interval of repose.

In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the country
derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed not often to
reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,--on
their sufferings,--and on the sacrifice of valuable life, by which
so many national benefits are obtained and preserved.

The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties; and
their character has been established in Continental warfare by the
irresistible spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the gallantry and
steadiness with which they have maintained their advantages against
superior numbers.

In the Official Reports made by the respective Commanders, ample
justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions of the
Corps employed; but the details of their services and of acts of
individual bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.

These Records are now preparing for publication, under His
Majesty’s special authority, by Mr. RICHARD CANNON, Principal Clerk
of the Adjutant General’s Office; and while the perusal of them
cannot fail to be useful and interesting to military men of every
rank, it is considered that they will also afford entertainment and
information to the general reader, particularly to those who may
have served in the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.

There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served, or
are serving, in the Army, an _Esprit de Corps_--an attachment
to everything belonging to their Regiment; to such persons a
narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of the great, the
valiant, the loyal, have always been of paramount interest with
a brave and civilized people. Great Britain has produced a race
of heroes who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood “firm
as the rocks of their native shore:” and when half the world has
been arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,--victories so complete and surprising, gained
by our countrymen, our brothers, our fellow-citizens in arms,--a
record which revives the memory of the brave, and brings their
gallant deeds before us,--will certainly prove acceptable to the
public.

Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying the value
and importance of its services, will be faithfully set forth.

As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each Regiment
will be printed in a distinct number, so that when the whole shall
be completed the Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.




INTRODUCTION

TO

THE INFANTRY.


The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been celebrated for
innate courage and unshaken firmness, and the national superiority
of the British troops over those of other countries has been
evinced in the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery, that no doubts can
be raised upon the facts which are recorded. It must therefore be
admitted, that the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
INTREPIDITY. This quality was evinced by the inhabitants of England
when their country was invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army,
on which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into the sea to
attack the Roman soldiers as they descended from their ships; and,
although their discipline and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing intimidated
the flower of the Roman troops, including Cæsar’s favourite tenth
legion. Their arms consisted of spears, short swords, and other
weapons of rude construction. They had chariots, to the axles of
which were fastened sharp pieces of iron resembling scythe-blades,
and infantry in long chariots resembling waggons, who alighted
and fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit or retreat,
sprang into the chariot and drove off with the speed of cavalry.
These inventions were, however, unavailing against Cæsar’s
legions: in the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and British courage, being
thus regulated, was exerted to the greatest advantage; a full
development of the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.

The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted principally of
infantry: Thanes, and other men of property, however, fought on
horseback. The infantry were of two classes, heavy and light. The
former carried large shields armed with spikes, long broad swords
and spears; and the latter were armed with swords or spears only.
They had also men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.

The feudal troops established by William the Conqueror consisted
(as already stated in the Introduction to the Cavalry) almost
entirely of horse: but when the warlike barons and knights, with
their trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although these were of inferior
degree, they proved stout-hearted Britons of stanch fidelity. When
stipendiary troops were employed, infantry always constituted a
considerable portion of the military force; and this _arme_ has
since acquired, in every quarter of the globe, a celebrity never
exceeded by the armies of any nation at any period.

The weapons carried by the infantry, during the several reigns
succeeding the Conquest, were bows and arrows, half-pikes, lances,
halberds, various kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of time the practice
became general for military men to be so completely cased in steel,
that it was almost impossible to slay them.

The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the destructive
purposes of war, in the early part of the fourteenth
century, produced a change in the arms and equipment of the
infantry-soldier. Bows and arrows gave place to various kinds of
fire-arms, but British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect bore of
the fire-arms when first introduced, a body of men, well trained
in the use of the bow from their youth, was considered a valuable
acquisition to every army, even as late as the sixteenth century.

During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth each company
of infantry usually consisted of men armed five different ways; in
every hundred men forty were “_men-at-arms_,” and sixty “_shot_;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe men, and
thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were twenty archers, twenty
musketeers, and twenty harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides
his principal weapon, a sword and dagger.

Companies of infantry varied at this period in numbers from 150
to 300 men; each company had a colour or ensign, and the mode of
formation recommended by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was; the colour in the centre of the company
guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen in equal proportions, on
each flank of the halberdiers; half the musketeers on each flank
of the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were much lighter than the
muskets then in use) in equal proportions on each flank of the
company for skirmishing.[1] It was customary to unite a number
of companies into one body, called a REGIMENT, which frequently
amounted to three thousand men; but each company continued to carry
a colour. Numerous improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found impossible to
make armour proof against the muskets then in use (which carried
a very heavy ball) without its being too weighty for the soldier,
armour was gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse, and the infantry
were reduced to two classes, viz.: _musketeers_, armed with
matchlock muskets, swords, and daggers; and _pikemen_, armed with
pikes from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.

In the early part of the seventeenth century Gustavus Adolphus,
King of Sweden, reduced the strength of regiments to 1000 men. He
caused the gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in flasks,
or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing a charge, to be
made up into cartridges, and carried in pouches; and he formed
each regiment into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of Pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming four regiments
into a brigade; and the number of colours was afterwards reduced to
three in each regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that his
infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated Polish horsemen
and Austrian cuirassiers; and his armies became the admiration of
other nations. His mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great was the prejudice
in favour of ancient customs, that all his improvements were not
adopted until near a century afterwards.

In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service, styled
the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678 each company of 100 men usually
consisted of 30 pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with light
firelocks. In this year the King added a company of men armed with
hand grenades to each of the old British regiments, which was
designated the “grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived as to
fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets, similar to those
at present in use, were adopted about twenty years afterwards.

An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by order of King James
II., to guard the artillery, and was designated the Royal Fusiliers
(now 7th Foot). This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.

King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s regiment in the second
Foot Guards, and raised two Marine regiments for sea-service.
During the war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14 pikemen and 46
musketeers; the captains carried pikes; lieutenants, partisans;
ensigns, half-pikes; and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in
1697 the Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again formed on
the breaking out of the war in 1702.[2]

During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were laid aside, and every
infantry soldier was armed with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the
grenadiers ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside their third colour:
the corps of Royal Artillery was first added to the Army in this
reign.

About the year 1745, the men of the battalion companies of infantry
ceased to carry swords; during the reign of George II. light
companies were added to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers should lay aside
their swords, as that weapon had never been used during the Seven
Years’ War. Since that period the arms of the infantry soldier have
been limited to the musket and bayonet.

The arms and equipment of the British Troops have seldom differed
materially, since the Conquest, from those of other European
states; and in some respects the arming has, at certain periods,
been allowed to be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage, the bravery and
superiority of the British infantry have been evinced on very many
and most trying occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.

Great Britain has produced a rate of lion-like champions who have
dared to confront a host of foes, and have proved themselves
valiant with any arms. At _Crecy_, King Edward III., at the head
of about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August, 1346, Philip
King of France, whose army is said to have amounted to 100,000
men; here British valour encountered veterans of renown:--the
King of Bohemia, the King of Majorca, and many princes and nobles
were slain, and the French army was routed and cut to pieces. Ten
years afterwards, Edward Prince of Wales, who was designated the
Black Prince, defeated at _Poictiers_, with 14,000 men, a French
army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry, and took John I., King of
France, and his son, Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October,
1415, King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000 men, although
greatly exhausted by marches, privations, and sickness, defeated,
at _Agincourt_, the Constable of France, at the head of the flower
of the French nobility and an army said to amount to 60,000 men,
and gained a complete victory.

During the seventy years’ war between the United Provinces of the
Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy, which commenced in 1578 and
terminated in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable spirit and
firmness;[3] and in the thirty years’ war between the Protestant
Princes and the Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the
service of Sweden and other states were celebrated for deeds of
heroism.[4] In the wars of Queen Anne, the fame of the British
army under the great MARLBOROUGH was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed within the memory
of persons now living, there is abundant proof that the Britons
of the present age are not inferior to their ancestors in the
qualities which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds of
the brave men, of whom there are many now surviving, who fought in
Egypt in 1801, under the brave Abercromby, and compelled the French
army, which had been vainly styled _Invincible_, to evacuate that
country; also the services of the gallant Troops during the arduous
campaigns in the Peninsula, under the immortal WELLINGTON; and
the determined stand made by the British Army at Waterloo, where
Napoleon Bonaparte, who had long been the inveterate enemy of Great
Britain, and had sought and planned her destruction by every means
he could devise, was compelled to leave his vanquished legions to
their fate, and to place himself at the disposal of the British
Government. These achievements, with others of recent dates, in the
distant climes of India, prove that the same valour and constancy
which glowed in the breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers,
Agincourt, Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the Britons
of the nineteenth century.

The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust and muscular
frame,--intrepidity which no danger can appal,--unconquerable
spirit and resolution,--patience in fatigue and privation, and
cheerful obedience to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate and give
a skilful direction to the energies and adventurous spirit of
the hero, and a wise selection of officers of superior talent to
command, whose presence inspires confidence,--have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British arms.[5]
The fame of the deeds of the past and present generations in the
various battle-fields where the robust sons of Albion have fought
and conquered, surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to the end of
time.

The records of the several regiments will be found to contain a
detail of facts of an interesting character, connected with the
hardships, sufferings, and gallant exploits of British soldiers in
the various parts of the world where the calls of their Country
and the commands of their Sovereign have required them to proceed
in the execution of their duty, whether in active continental
operations, or in maintaining colonial territories in distant and
unfavourable climes.

The superiority of the British infantry has been pre-eminently set
forth in the wars of six centuries, and admitted by the greatest
commanders which Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this _arme_, as at present practised, while they are adapted
to every species of warfare, and to all probable situations
and circumstances of service, are calculated to show forth the
brilliancy of military tactics calculated upon mathematical and
scientific principles. Although the movements and evolutions have
been copied from the continental armies, yet various improvements
have from time to time been introduced, to ensure that simplicity
and celerity by which the superiority of the national military
character is maintained. The rank and influence which Great Britain
has attained among the nations of the world, have in a great
measure been purchased by the valour of the Army, and to persons
who have the welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.

in 1702, and were employed as such during the wars in the reign
of Queen Anne. The Marine corps were embarked in the Fleet under
Admiral Sir George Rooke, and were at the taking of Gibraltar, and
in its subsequent defence in 1704; they were afterwards employed at
the siege of Barcelona in 1705.

[3] The brave Sir Roger Williams, in his Discourse on War, printed
in 1590, observes:--“I persuade myself ten thousand of our nation
would beat thirty thousand of theirs (the Spaniards) out of the
field, let them be chosen where they list.” Yet at this time the
Spanish infantry was allowed to be the best disciplined in Europe.

[5] “Under the blessing of Divine Providence, His Majesty ascribes
the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in
Egypt to that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but
His Majesty desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed
on the consideration of every part of the army, that it has been a
strict observance of order, discipline, and military system, which
has given the full energy to the native valour of the troops, and
has enabled them proudly to assert the superiority of the national
military character, in situations uncommonly arduous, and under
circumstances of peculiar difficulty.”--_General Orders in 1801._

In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the
successful result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January
1809, it is stated:--“On no occasion has the undaunted valour of
British troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a
severe and harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority
which the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be
encountered. These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the
troops themselves: and the enemy has been taught, that whatever
advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there is
inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows
not how to yield,--that no circumstances can appal,--and that will
ensure victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any
human means.”

INTRODUCTION

TO THE

HISTORICAL RECORD

OF THE

SEVENTY-FIRST REGIMENT,

HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY.


During the last century several corps, at successive periods, have
been borne on the establishment of the army, and numbered the
SEVENTY-FIRST; the following details are therefore prefixed to the
historical record of the services of the regiment which now bears
that number, in order to prevent its being connected with those
corps which have been designated by the same numerical title, but
whose services have been totally distinct.


1. In the spring of 1758 the second battalions of fifteen regiments
of infantry, from the 3d to the 37th, were directed to be formed
into distinct regiments, and to be numbered from the 61st to the
75th successively, as follows:--

_Second Battalions._

   3d foot constituted the  61st regiment.
   4th  ”          ”        62d      ”
   8th  ”          ”        63d      ”
  11th  ”          ”        64th     ”
  12th  ”          ”        65th     ”
  19th  ”          ”        66th     ”
  20th  ”          ”        67th     ”
  23d   ”          ”        68th     ”
  24th  ”          ”        69th     ”
  31st  ”          ”        70th     ”
  32d   ”          ”        71st     ”
  33d   ”          ”        72d      ”
  34th  ”          ”        73d      ”
  36th  ”          ”        74th     ”
  37th  ”          ”        75th     ”

The 71st, 72d, 73d, 74th, and 75th regiments, thus formed, were
disbanded in 1763, after the peace of Fontainebleau.


2. Several other corps were likewise disbanded in 1763, which
occasioned a change in the numerical titles of the following
regiments of Invalids, viz.:--

  The 81st reg^t (Invalids) was numbered the 71st.
      82d          ”         ”     ”         72d.
     116th         ”         ”     ”         73d.
     117th         ”         ”     ”         74th.
     118th         ”         ”     ”         75th.

The 71st, 72d, 73d, 74th, and 75th regiments, thus numbered, were
formed into independent companies of Invalids in the year 1769,
which increased the number of _Invalid companies_ from eight to
twenty; they were appropriated to the following Garrisons, namely,
four companies at Guernsey, four at Jersey, three at Hull, two at
Chester, two at Tilbury Fort, two at Sheerness, one at Landguard
Fort, one at Pendennis, and one in the Scilly Islands.


3. These numerical titles became thus extinct until October
1775, when another SEVENTY-FIRST regiment was raised for service
in America by Major-General the Honorable Simon Fraser, which
consisted of two battalions, and which performed eminent service
during the war with the colonists. In December 1777, further
augmentations were made to the army, and the regiments, which were
directed to be raised, were numbered from the seventy-second to the
eighty-third regiment.

The army was subsequently increased to one hundred and five regular
regiments of infantry, exclusive of eleven unnumbered regiments,
and thirty-six independent companies of Invalids.

The conclusion of the general peace in 1783 occasioned the
disbandment of several regiments, commencing with the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment; the second battalion of which was disbanded on the 5th
April 1783, and the first battalion on the 4th June 1784.


4. In 1786 the numerical titles of certain regiments, retained on
the reduced establishment of the army, were changed, viz.:--

The _seventy-third_, which had been authorised to be raised
by John Lord Macleod in 1777, was directed to be numbered the
SEVENTY-FIRST regiment.

The _seventy-eighth_, which had been authorised to be raised by
the Earl of Seaforth in 1777, was directed to be numbered the
SEVENTY-SECOND regiment.

The _second battalion_ of the _forty-second_, which had been
authorised to be raised in 1779, was directed to be constituted the
SEVENTY-THIRD regiment.

These corps were denominated Highland regiments, and have since
continued to form part of the regular army.

The details of the services of the present SEVENTY-FIRST regiment
are contained in the following pages; the histories of the
_seventy-second_ and _seventy-third_ regiments are given in
distinct numbers.

OF THE

SEVENTY-FIRST REGIMENT,

HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY;

ORIGINALLY NUMBERED

THE SEVENTY-THIRD REGIMENT.


[Sidenote: 1777.]

The war between Great Britain and her American Colonies had,
towards the end of the year 1777, assumed an aspect which was
beheld with great interest by the European powers. France, although
abstaining at this period from entering into the contest, privately
encouraged the colonists, and several French officers proceeded to
join the American standard. The influence of the British ministry
then became employed in encouraging voluntary efforts for the
raising of troops. Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh, and Glasgow,
at their own expense, each raised a regiment of a thousand men, and
several independent companies were levied in Wales. The livery of
London and corporation of Bristol did not follow this example, but
the monied interest in the metropolis showed its attachment to the
administration by opening a subscription for procuring soldiers.

Fifteen thousand men were by these patriotic efforts raised and
presented to the state; of this number upwards of two thirds were
obtained from Scotland, and principally from the _Highland_
clans.[6] The hardy mountaineers of North Britain had been long
celebrated for their military prowess, and the annals of warfare of
subsequent years have added to their former renown, by affording
them opportunities for sustaining their character for intrepidity
and valour.

The present SEVENTY-FIRST, HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY, was one of the
regiments which owes its origin to the foregoing circumstances, and
was raised under the following royal warrant, dated 19th December
1777, addressed to John Mackenzie, Esquire, commonly called John
Lord Macleod, who was appointed its colonel.

  “GEORGE R.

  “WHEREAS we have thought fit to order a Highland regiment of
  foot to be forthwith raised under your command, to consist of
  ten companies, of five serjeants, five corporals, two drummers,
  and one hundred private men in each, with two pipers to the
  grenadier company, besides commissioned officers, these are to
  authorise you, by beat of drum or otherwise, to raise so many men
  in any county or part of our kingdom of Great Britain as shall
  be wanting to complete the said regiment to the above-mentioned
  numbers; and all magistrates, justices of the peace, constables,
  and other our civil officers, whom it may concern, are hereby
  required to be assisting unto you, in providing quarters,
  impressing carriages, and otherwise, as there shall be occasion.

  “Given at our Court at St. James’s, this 19th of December 1777,
  in the eighteenth year of our reign.

  “_By His Majesty’s command_,

  “BARRINGTON.”

  “_To our trusty and well-beloved John Mackenzie, Esq., (commonly
  called John Lord Macleod), Colonel of a Highland Regiment of Foot
  to be forthwith raised, or to the Officer appointed by him to
  raise Men for our said Regiment._”

[Sidenote: 1778.]

In February 1778 the Court of France concluded a treaty of
defensive alliance with the American colonies, and Great Britain
became involved in a war with France.

Lord Macleod’s efforts in raising the regiment were so successful
that in April 1778 it was embodied at Elgin, under the denomination
of “_Macleod’s Highlanders_,” and was numbered the “SEVENTY-THIRD
REGIMENT.”

In May the regiment, eleven hundred strong, embarked at Fort
George, under the command of Colonel Lord Macleod, and proceeded
to Guernsey and Jersey, in which islands it was stationed for six
months. The regiment was subsequently removed to Portsmouth, and
was cantoned during the remainder of the year in the neighbouring
villages.

On the 24th of September, 1778, Colonel Lord Macleod received
orders to raise a second battalion to the regiment. Each battalion
was to consist of fifty serjeants, fifty corporals, twenty drummers
and fifers, two pipers, and a thousand privates.

At this period the following officers had been appointed to the
SEVENTY-THIRD HIGHLAND Regiment.

[Sidenote: 1779.]

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

In January 1779 the first battalion of the regiment, commanded by
Colonel Lord John Macleod, embarked for the East Indies.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

The second battalion, one thousand strong, embarked at Fort George
in Scotland, in March 1779, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel the
Hon. George Mackenzie (brother of Lord Macleod), and proceeded to
Portsmouth, from thence it went on in transports to Plymouth, where
the battalion landed, and was encamped upon Maker Heights until the
27th of November following.

The Court of Versailles had now engaged that of Madrid to take
a part in the contest, and on the 16th of June 1779 the Spanish
ambassador had presented a manifesto at St. James’s, equivalent
to a declaration of war, and immediately departed from London.
During the summer the siege of Gibraltar was commenced by the
Spaniards, the reduction of that important fortress being one of
the principal objects of Spain in becoming a party to the war.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

The vessels conveying the first battalion formed part of a fleet
escorted by Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, which on the passage
touched at Goree, upon the coast of Africa. Goree being evacuated
by the French for the purpose of fortifying Senegal, which had
been captured by them early in the year, was occupied by a British
force, left for that purpose by Sir Edward Hughes.

After quitting Goree, the fleet proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope,
at that time in possession of the Dutch, and there landed the sick.
The fleet was detained for three months in Table Bay, for the
purpose of refreshment and recovery of the sick, after which it
sailed for India.

[Sidenote: 1780.]

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

After the breaking up of the camp on Maker Heights, the second
battalion embarked for Gibraltar in transports, under convoy of
Admiral Sir George Rodney. When in the Bay of Biscay, the British
encountered, on the 8th of January 1780, a valuable Spanish
convoy belonging to the Caracca company, consisting of fifteen
merchantmen, with a ship of sixty-four guns, and two frigates, the
whole of which were captured. Sir George Rodney being compelled
to employ many of the crews of the ships of war in manning the
prizes, called upon Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. George Mackenzie for
the services of the second battalion of the regiment as _Marines_.
In a few days after the men were distributed for this purpose,
the fleet defeated, on the 16th of January, off Cape St. Vincent,
a squadron of eleven sail of the line, commanded by Admiral Don
Juan de Langara. One Spanish ship of seventy guns blew up in the
beginning of the action. The Spanish admiral’s ship of eighty guns,
and three of seventy, were taken; one of seventy guns ran on shore,
and another was lost on the breakers.

Nothing further transpired during the remainder of the voyage,
and on the 18th of January 1780 the second battalion disembarked
at Gibraltar, then closely blockaded by the Spaniards, who had
despatched Don Juan de Langara to intercept the British admiral.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

The first battalion had, in the meantime, continued on its voyage
to India, and on the 20th of January 1780 anchored in Madras Roads,
being twelve months from the time of leaving England. The battalion
landed immediately at Fort St. George, and after remaining there
about a month was removed to Poonamallee.

The intricate politics of India gave rise to a war in that country.
Hyder Ali, the son of a petty chief in the Mysore, had risen to the
chief command of the army of that state, and when the rajah died,
leaving his eldest son a minor, Hyder assumed the guardianship of
the youthful prince, whom he placed under restraint, and seized
on the reins of government. Having a considerable territory under
his control, he maintained a formidable military establishment,
which he endeavoured to bring into a high state of discipline and
efficiency. Hyder, now Sultan of Mysore, formed a league with
the French, and entered into a confederacy with the Nizam of the
Deccan, the Mahrattas, and other of the native powers, for the
purpose of expelling the British from India.

In July 1780, Hyder Ali, having passed the Ghauts (as the passes in
the mountains on both sides of the Indian peninsula are termed),
burst like a torrent into the Carnatic, while his son, Tippoo Saib,
advanced with a large body of cavalry against the northern Circars,
and the villages in the vicinity of Madras were attacked by parties
of the enemy’s horse.

These events occasioned the first battalion of the regiment to be
ordered to proceed to join the army which was being assembled at
St. Thomas’s Mount, under the command of Major-General Sir Hector
Munro, K.B., consisting entirely of the troops of the Honorable
East India Company, with the exception of the _Seventy-third_, then
about 800 strong.

Sir Hector Munro’s army amounted to upwards of 4,000 men, and was
thus composed:--

           { Infantry     1,000
  European { Artillery      300
           { Dragoons        30

  Native   { Infantry     3,250
           { Dragoons        30
                         ------
                  Total   4,610
                         ======

With the army were also thirty field-pieces and howitzers, together
with four battering twenty-four pounders.

The Anglo-Indian army marched to Conjeveram, sixty miles westward
of Madras, where it was to be joined by a detachment from the
northward, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Baillie.

At this period the Sultan of Mysore was engaged in besieging
_Arcot_, the capital of the Carnatic, which was invested by the
enemy on the 21st of August. The movement of Sir Hector Munro’s
force caused Hyder Ali to raise the siege; he then detached his
son, Tippoo Saib, with a large body of horse and foot, amounting to
24,000 men and twelve guns, to intercept Lieut.-Colonel Baillie,
whose junction with the main army had been ordered.

In this manœuvre Tippoo Saib succeeded, and Major-General Sir
Hector Munro was compelled to detach Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher with
a thousand men to reinforce Lieut.-Colonel Baillie. The flank
companies of the first battalion of the _Seventy-third_ formed
part of this detachment; the grenadier company was commanded by
Lieutenant the Honorable John Lindsay, and the light company by
Captain, afterwards General the Right Hon. Sir David Baird, Bart.
and G.C.B.[7]

On the 6th of September, Lieut.-Colonel Baillie was attacked at
Perambaukum by the division under Tippoo Saib, and on the 9th
of that month was joined by the detachment under Lieut.-Colonel
Fletcher. On the following day they were attacked by Hyder’s whole
army, and the officers and men of this ill-fated detachment were
either killed, taken, or dispersed.

The following graphic description of this unequal contest with
Hyder’s whole army, the division under Tippoo Saib acting in
concert, is given by Captain Innes Munro, of the _Seventy-third_,
who published a “Narrative of the Military Operations on the
Coromandel Coast from 1780 to 1784:”--

“Lieut.-Colonel Baillie could but make a feeble resistance
against so superior a force; but his little band yet gallantly
supported a very unequal fire, until their whole ammunition had
either been blown up or expended, which of course silenced the
British artillery. Hyder’s guns upon this drew nearer and nearer
at every discharge, while each shot was attended with certain and
deadly effect. Lieut.-Colonel Baillie’s detachment, seeing their
artillery silenced and remaining inactive while exposed to certain
destruction, very naturally became dismayed; which the enemy no
sooner perceived than they made a movement for a general charge
and advanced on all quarters to a close attack. At this dangerous
and trying juncture, sufficient to damp the spirits of the most
intrepid, all the camp-followers rushed in confusion through the
ranks of every battalion, and in an instant threw the whole into
disorder. The black troops, finding themselves in this calamitous
situation, relinquished every hope of success; and, notwithstanding
the extraordinary exertions of their European officers, were no
more to be rallied. But such of the Europeans as had fallen into
disorder by this irregularity, quickly united again in compact
order, headed by their gallant commander, who was at this time
much wounded; and, being joined by all the Sepoy officers, planted
themselves upon a rising bank of sand in their vicinity, where they
valiantly resolved to defend themselves to the last extremity.

“History cannot produce an instance, for fortitude, cool
intrepidity, and desperate resolution, to equal the exploits
of this heroic band. In numbers, now reduced to five hundred,
they were opposed by no less than one hundred thousand enraged
barbarians, who seldom grant quarter. The mind, in the
contemplation of such a scene, and such a situation as theirs was,
is filled at once with admiration, with astonishment, with horror,
and with awe. To behold formidable and impenetrable bodies of
horse, of infantry, and of artillery, advancing from all quarters,
flashing savage fury, levelling the numberless instruments of
slaughter, and darting destruction around, was a scene to appal
even something more than the strongest human resolution; but it was
beheld by this little band with the most undaunted and immovable
firmness. Distinct bodies of horse came on successively to the
charge, with strong parties of infantry placed in the intervals,
whose fire was discharged in showers; but the deliberate and
well-leveled platoons of the British musketry had such a powerful
effect as to repulse several different attacks. Like the swelling
waves of the ocean, however, when agitated by a storm, fresh
columns incessantly poured in upon them with redoubled fury, which
at length brought so many to the ground, and weakened their fire
so considerably, that they were unable longer to withstand the
dreadful and tremendous shock; and the field soon presented a
picture of the most inhuman cruelties and unexampled carnage.

“The last and awful struggle was marked by the clashing of arms
and shields, the snorting and kicking of horses, the snapping of
spears, the glistening of bloody swords, oaths and imprecations;
concluding with the groans and cries of bruised and mutilated men,
wounded horses tumbling to the ground upon expiring soldiers, and
the hideous roaring of elephants, stalking to and fro, and wielding
their dreadful chains alike amongst friends and foes.

       *       *       *       *       *

“Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher and twenty-nine European officers, with
one hundred and fifty-five European rank and file, were killed;
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, with thirty-four officers, and almost all
the European privates, were miserably wounded; sixteen officers and
privates, from a Divine protection, and the generous clemency of
the French hussars, remained unhurt, who, with the rest, were all
made prisoners. The whole of the sepoys were either killed, taken,
or dispersed.”

The flank companies were almost annihilated. Captain Baird received
seven wounds, and Lieutenant the Hon. John Lindsay nine; both were
made prisoners.

Lieutenant Philip Melvill[8] was totally disabled by his wounds,
and was conveyed to Hyder’s camp, where many other wounded
prisoners were crowded together in one tent, so as to prevent a
moment’s ease or rest. They were afterwards confined at Bangalore,
where they endured the greatest suffering for three years and a
half, when, peace being concluded, the captives were released.

Lieutenant William Gunn, of the grenadiers, and Lieutenant Geddes
Mackenzie, of the light company, were killed.

These were the whole of the officers serving with the two
companies. Of the non-commissioned officers and privates only
two men joined the battalion, and those were found in the jungle
desperately wounded.

The melancholy fate of these companies rendered it necessary for
Colonel Lord Macleod to form two new flank companies from the
battalion.

After the defeat of Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, Major General Sir
Hector Munro retired with the army to Chingleput, much pressed
on the march by the enemy. The wounded and sick being left at
Chingleput, the army went into cantonments on Choultry Plain for
the rainy season, which had set in. The troops in the retreat had
suffered severely from fatigue and want of provisions.

Captain Alexander Gilchrist, of the grenadiers, whose ill-health
prevented him from being with his company when Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie was attacked, died at this period[9], and Lieutenant
Alexander Mackenzie was wounded, together with several soldiers, in
skirmishes with the enemy.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

After the British fleet had departed from Gibraltar the Spaniards
renewed the blockade by sea, and attempted to destroy the vessels
in the harbour by fire-ships, but failed. Towards the close of
the year provisions again became short. A limited supply was
occasionally obtained from the Moors. The effects of the scurvy
were mitigated by cultivating vegetables on the rock; and the brave
defenders of the fortress maintained their attitude of defiance to
the power of Spain.

Mr. Laurens, late President of the American Congress, having been
captured in his passage to Holland by the British, papers were
found on him showing that a treaty of alliance was on the point
of conclusion between the Americans and the States General. Great
Britain in consequence declared war against Holland on the 20th of
December, and thus became engaged with a fourth enemy, exclusive of
the hostile powers in India.

[Sidenote: 1781.]

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

Upon the 17th of January 1781, the army being re-assembled, took
the field under the command of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, K.B.,
Commander-in-Chief in India. At this period the strength of the
first battalion did not exceed five hundred men. Hyder Ali was then
in the Tanjore country, committing every species of outrage and
devastation.

On the 1st of June, 1781, Colonel Lord Macleod received the local
rank of Major-General in the East Indies. In June Sir Eyre Coote
moved the army along the coast southerly, towards Cuddalore, where
his out-posts were attacked by Tippoo Saib, who was repulsed.
The British commander afterwards marched his whole force to
Chillumborem, upon the Coleroon, where the enemy had a large
magazine of grain.

The pagoda was attacked by the piquets under the command of Captain
John Shaw, of the first battalion, but the detachment was repulsed,
and that officer wounded.

Hyder Ali, being apprehensive for the safety of Chillumborem,
moved his army in the direction of that place from Tanjore and
Trichinopoly, while Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, with the
view of obtaining supplies from the shipping, proceeded towards
Cuddalore. Hyder, by forced marches and manœuvres, had nearly
surrounded the British on the plains of _Porto Novo_, about two
days’ march to the southward of Cuddalore.

At four o’clock in the morning of the 1st of July, Sir Eyre Coote
put his army of about 8,000 men in movement, while that of the
enemy, computed at 100,000, was observed to range itself in order
of battle.

The army of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote formed on the plain in
two lines; the first battalion was commanded by Colonel James
Craufurd[10] (Lord Macleod having returned to England), and had its
station in the first line under the orders of Major General Sir
Hector Munro. Major General James Stuart commanded the second line.
The action commenced by an advanced movement of the English troops,
and the contest was sustained with great spirit by both parties
until night, when the firing ceased, and the British remained
masters of the field.

The veteran chief, Sir Eyre Coote, was so well pleased with the
conduct of the battalion upon this occasion that he was heard to
exclaim, addressing himself in the heat of the battle to one of
the pipers, “Well done, my brave fellow, you shall have silver
pipes when the battle is over!” The general did not forget his
promise, and in addition to a general order expressive of his sense
of the gallantry and steadiness of the battalion in the battle of
_Porto Novo_, he presented a handsome pair of silver pipes (value
one hundred pagodas[11]) to the corps, upon which was engraved a
suitable inscription; this he desired might be preserved as a
lasting monument of his approbation of its conduct in that battle,
the result of which enabled Sir Eyre Coote to reach Cuddalore, the
point of destination, on the 4th of July.

Shortly afterwards the army was moved to St. Thomas’s Mount.

On the 3d of August the force from Bengal, under the orders of
Colonel Pearse, arrived and formed a junction with Sir Eyre Coote’s
army at Pulicat, to which place the army had moved in order to
facilitate that important object. The British force now amounted to
twelve thousand men.

The first brigade, composed entirely of Europeans, was commanded by
Colonel Craufurd, of the present SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, and had
its station generally in the centre of the line. Major General Sir
Hector Munro commanded the right wing, and Colonel Pearse the left.

In August, Major James Mackenzie of the battalion died, universally
regretted. His exertions in the early part of the campaign had
brought on illness, which terminated his career.

On the 16th of August the preparations that had been carried on
for the siege of _Arcot_, which had been taken by Hyder Ali in the
previous year, and for the relief of _Vellore_ being completed,
the Anglo-Indian army was put in movement. On the 20th of August
_Tripassoor_ was retaken, by which capture a very large supply
of grain fell into the hands of the British. The camp of Hyder’s
main army was at Conjeveram, and every exertion was made by his
detachments to interrupt the progress of the British troops.

The British, on the 27th of August, came in sight of the
enemy, drawn up in order of battle upon the very ground where
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie had met his defeat, a position which the
religious notions of Hyder Ali induced him to consider fortunate.
Thus encouraged or inspired, he seemed determined to hazard a
second general action, and accordingly commenced the attack by a
smart cannonade, when an obstinate contest ensued, which lasted the
whole day, and which terminated in his defeat, and his being forced
to retire from all his positions.

There was a circumstance peculiar to this field of battle which
stamped it with aggravated horrors. It is ably and feelingly
described by Captain Munro in his Narrative, from which the
following is extracted.[12]

“Perhaps there come not within the wide range of human imagination
scenes more affecting, or circumstances more touching, than many
of our army had that day to witness and to bear. On the very spot
where they stood lay strewed amongst their feet the relics of their
dearest fellow soldiers and friends, who near twelve months before
had been slain by the hands of those very inhuman monsters that
now appeared a second time eager to complete the work of blood.
One poor soldier, with the tear of affection glistening in his
eye, picked up the decaying spatter-dash of his valued brother,
with the name yet entire upon it, which the tinge of blood and
effects of weather had kindly spared. Another discovered the club
or plaited hair of his bosom friend, which he himself had helped
to form, and knew by the tie and still remaining colour. A third
mournfully recognised the feather which had decorated the cap of
his inseparable companion. The scattered clothes and wings of the
flank companies of the _Seventy-third_ were everywhere perceptible,
as also their helmets and skulls, both of which bore the marks of
many furrowed cuts. These horrid spectacles, too melancholy to
dwell upon, while they melted the hardest hearts, inflamed our
soldiers with an enthusiasm and thirst of revenge such as render
men invincible; but their ardour was necessarily checked by the
involved situation of the army.”

Upon this horrid spot the army halted two days, and it then retired
to Tripassoor, to secure provisions. At this period the health of
Major-General Sir Hector Munro compelled him to leave the army.

On the 19th of September, Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote made a
movement towards _Vellore_, the relief of which place Hyder Ali
appeared determined to oppose, by occupying in order of battle the
Pass of _Sholingur_, at the same time making very spirited attacks
against the fortress of Vellore.

Upon the 27th of September, Colonel Craufurd, now second in
command, received the orders of the Commander-in-Chief to move the
British army to the front.[13] Hyder, confident of success, made
a forward movement to meet his opponents, when a general action
commenced. A detachment, commanded by Colonel Edmonstone, (of which
the flank companies of the first battalion formed part,) succeeded
in turning the left flank of the enemy, and fell upon his camp and
rear. The day closed by the total defeat of Hyder’s troops, who
were pursued by the cavalry until sunset.

Under circumstances the most distressing and unpromising, but
with the hope of obtaining the supplies of provisions of which the
army was quite destitute, and for which no previous arrangement
had been made by the Government, Lieut. General Sir Eyre Coote, on
the 1st of October, boldly pushed through the Sholingur Pass, and
after a march of two days encamped at Altamancherry, in the Polygar
country. Here, by the friendly aid and kindness of Bum-Raze, one
of the Polygar princes, the troops were well supplied with every
requisite.

The British camp was moved on the 26th of October to Pollipet,
and the sick and wounded were sent to Tripassoor. Vellore was
also relieved. This desirable object being effected, and the army
reinforced by Colonel Laing with a hundred Europeans from Vellore,
it proceeded to the attack of Chittoor, which, after a gallant
resistance, capitulated.

With a view to get the British from a country so very inaccessible,
Hyder Ali proceeded to the attack of Tripassoor, and on the 20th
of November Sir Eyre Coote retired out of the Pollams, through
the Naggary Pass, which obliged the enemy to raise the siege of
Tripassoor, and to retire to Arcot. The campaign closed by the
recapture of Chittoor by the enemy.

On the 2d of December, the monsoon having set in, the army broke up
its camp on the Koilatoor Plain, and the different corps marched
into cantonments in the neighbourhood of Madras.

During the campaign of 1781, the battalion was commanded by Captain
John Shaw.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

While the first battalion had been thus actively employed in
India, the second battalion was engaged in the gallant defence of
_Gibraltar_, the garrison of which was again relieved, in April
1781, by the arrival of a numerous fleet under Vice-Admiral Darby.

The Spaniards, relinquishing all hope of reducing the fortress by
blockade, resolved to try the power of their numerous artillery.
Scarcely had the fleet cast anchor, when the enemy’s batteries
opened, and the fire of upwards of one hundred guns and mortars
enveloped the fortress in a storm of war; a number of gun-boats
augmented the iron tempest which beat against the rock, and the
houses of the inhabitants were soon in ruins. On the 8th of May,
Captain James Foulis, of the second battalion of the regiment, was
wounded in the lines.

On the night of the 17th of September the following incident
relating to the battalion occurred in an attack of the enemy, the
account of which is extracted from the “History of the Siege of
Gibraltar,” by Colonel John Drinkwater, of the late Seventy-second
Regiment, or Royal Manchester Volunteers:--

“A shell during the above attack fell in an embrasure opposite
the King’s lines bomb-proof, killed one of the SEVENTY-THIRD,
and wounded another of the same corps. The case of the latter
was singular, and will serve to enforce the maxim, that, even in
the most dangerous cases, we should never despair of a recovery
whilst life remains. This unfortunate man was knocked down by
the wind of the shell, which, instantly bursting, killed his
companion, and mangled him in a most dreadful manner. His head was
terribly fractured, his left arm broken in two places, one of his
legs shattered, the skin and muscles torn off part of his right
hand, the middle finger broken to pieces, and his whole body most
severely bruised, and marked with gunpowder. He presented so horrid
an object to the surgeons, that they had not the smallest hopes of
saving his life, and were at a loss what part to attend to first.
He was that evening trepanned, a few days afterwards his leg was
amputated, and other wounds and fractures dressed. Being possessed
of a most excellent constitution, nature performed wonders in his
favour, and in eleven weeks the cure was completely effected. His
name is Donald Ross, and he long continued to enjoy his sovereign’s
bounty in a pension of ninepence a day for life.”

On the 4th of November, Lieutenant John Fraser, of the second
battalion, had his leg shot off on Montague’s Bastion, and two of
the soldiers of the battalion were likewise wounded by the enemy’s
fire.

General Eliott, afterwards Lord Heathfield, which title was
conferred for the services performed by him when Governor of
Gibraltar, in order to free himself from the contiguity of the
besiegers, resolved to make a _sortie_. The favourable opportunity
presented itself; and, on the evening of the 26th of November, the
following garrison order was issued:--

  “COUNTERSIGN, STEADY.--All the grenadiers and light infantry in
  the garrison, and all the men of the Twelfth and Hardenberg’s
  regiments, with the officers and non-commissioned officers on
  duty, to be immediately relieved and join their regiments; to
  form a detachment, consisting of the Twelfth and Hardenberg’s
  regiments complete; the grenadiers and light infantry of all
  the other regiments; one captain, three lieutenants, ten
  non-commissioned officers, and a hundred artillery; three
  engineers, seven officers, ten non-commissioned officers,
  overseers, with a hundred and sixty workmen from the line,
  and forty workmen from the artificer corps; each man to have
  thirty-six rounds of ammunition, with a good flint in his
  piece, and another in his pocket; the whole to be commanded by
  Brigadier-General Ross, and to assemble on the red sands, at
  twelve o’clock this night, to make a _sortie_ upon the enemy’s
  batteries. The thirty-ninth and fifty-eighth regiments to parade
  at the same hour, on the grand parade, under the command of
  Brigadier-General Picton, to sustain the _sortie_, if necessary.”

The flank companies of the second battalion, consisting of eight
officers, ten serjeants, and 202 rank and file, formed part of the
centre column. The moon shone brightly as the soldiers assembled
on the sands at midnight. Between two and three o’clock darkness
overspread the country, and the troops issued silently from the
fortress. They were challenged and fired upon by the enemy’s
sentries, but the British soldiers rushed forward with their native
ardour, overpowered the Spanish guards, and captured the batteries
in gallant style. The enemy’s soldiers, instead of defending the
works, fled in dismay, and communicated the panic to the troops in
their rear. The wooden batteries were soon prepared for fire; the
flames spread with astonishing rapidity, and a column of fire and
smoke arose from the works, illuminating the surrounding objects,
and shedding a fiery lustre upon this unparalleled scene.

In an hour the object of the _sortie_ was effected; trains were
laid to the enemy’s magazines, and the soldiers withdrew. As they
entered the fortress, tremendous explosions shook the ground, and
rising columns of smoke, flame, and burning timber proclaimed
the destruction of the enemy’s immense stores of gunpowder to be
completed. General Eliott declared in orders, “The bearing and
conduct of the whole detachment, officers, seamen, and soldiers, on
this glorious occasion, surpass my utmost acknowledgments.”

For several days the Spaniards appeared confounded at their
disgrace. The smoke of the burning batteries continued to rise,
and no attempt was made to extinguish the flames; but several
executions took place in their camp, probably of persons who fled
so precipitately from the batteries. In the beginning of December
they began to arouse themselves, and a thousand workmen commenced
labouring to restore the batteries, in which they were retarded by
the fire of the garrison.

While the besiegers were thus employed, the gallant defenders of
the fortress were equally indefatigable; every serjeant, drummer,
musician, officer’s servant, and private soldier, used the musket,
shovel, and pick-axe, as his services were necessary.

[Sidenote: 1782.]

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

At the opening of the campaign in India, in the beginning of 1782,
the army did not muster a larger force than at the commencement of
the former year. The first and most important object in view was
the relief of _Vellore_, kept in strict blockade by the enemy. The
safety of this fortress was of paramount consequence, being the
only key the British possessed to the Passes of the Ghauts, through
which an invasion of the enemy’s country could be accomplished;
and the army being put in movement, pushed through the Sholingur
Pass, and by the 11th of January the relief of _Vellore_, with
a supply of rice for six months, was fully effected. After the
accomplishment of this object the army retired, and on the 20th of
January arrived at Poonamallee, having lost upon this expedition
six officers and about thirty Europeans, with one hundred sepoys,
killed and wounded.

The following anecdote is extracted from the narrative of Captain
Munro, relating to the fall of John Mackay, a corporal of the
battalion, in one of the skirmishes with the enemy, when the army
was on the march to Vellore:--“For the satisfaction of my Highland
friends, I take this opportunity of commemorating the fall of
John Mackay, _alias_ Donn, a corporal in the _Seventy-third_ (now
SEVENTY-FIRST) regiment, son of Robert Donn, the famous Highland
bard, whose singular talent for the beautiful and extemporaneous
composition of Gaelic poetry was held in such esteem by the
Highland Society. This son of the bard has frequently revived the
drooping spirits of his countrymen upon the march, by singing in a
pleasant manner the humorous and lively productions of his father.
He was killed by a cannon ball on the 13th of January, and on the
same evening was interred by his disconsolate comrades with all the
honors of war.”

For the first three months of the year 1782, the army of
Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote was kept in a state of inactivity
at St. Thomas’s Mount, where it would appear the Government of
the presidency, apprehensive for its own safety, had detained
this force, while a judicious movement to Porto Novo might have
prevented the junction of the forces under Tippoo Saib with the
strong reinforcement of French troops that had arrived from Europe
on board the fleet of Admiral Suffrein, or at all events have
prevented the loss of Permacoil and Cuddalore.

At length Sir Eyre Coote, having been reinforced by the
Seventy-eighth, afterwards the Seventy-second regiment, recently
arrived from England, was permitted to put the army in movement.
In the beginning of April he marched in a southerly direction by
Carangooly and Wandewash towards the enemy, encamped upon the Red
Hills of Pondicherry. The object, which the Commander-in-chief
appeared to have in view, was to separate the French and Mysorean
troops, and he manœuvred accordingly between Chitaput and Arnee,
until Hyder Ali, apprehensive for the safety of the latter place,
where he had established magazines, made a rapid movement on the
2d of June, so as to overtake and attack the rear-guard of the
British, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel John Elphinston[14], of the
_Seventy-third_, who maintained his ground with great spirit and
intrepidity until the line had completed its formation. The troops
were ordered to advance immediately upon the enemy’s guns, the
action became very warm, and the foe was soon forced across the
river of _Arnee_, and in the pursuit several tumbrils were taken
by the Honorable Captain James Lindsay, of the battalion. This
gallant and intelligent officer, perceiving an enemy’s battalion
endeavouring to extricate the tumbrils in the bed of the river,
dashed forward at the head of his grenadier company, supported
by the remainder of the corps under Major George Mackenzie’s
command, and, quickly dispersing all opposed to his progress, took
possession of his prize. This movement of the _Seventy-third_ was
supported on the left by a battalion of Bengal Sepoys, who had
captured one of the enemy’s guns, and both corps, equally animated
by success, pushed on, driving the enemy before them as long as
pursuit was prudent.

The conduct of Captain the Honorable James Lindsay, although he had
acted without orders, received all the praise it merited from the
commander-in-chief, Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote. At the battle
of _Arnee_ the staff of the regimental colour was shattered by a
cannon ball, and the ensign severely wounded.

The army encamped for the night on the field of battle, and on the
following morning took up a position before Arnee; but a scarcity
of grain compelled the general to retrace his steps towards Madras,
and on the 20th of June he arrived at St. Thomas’s Mount.

In the months of July and August the army made two expeditions,
one to Wandewash, in which it was foiled by the active and politic
Hyder, the other for the relief of _Vellore_, in which it was more
fortunate, having succeeded in throwing a large quantity of grain
into that fortress.

The siege of Cuddalore having been determined on, the army moved
on the 26th of August in a southerly direction, and on the 4th
of September halted on the Red Hills of Pondicherry. Deserters
reported the garrison of Cuddalore to consist of 800 Europeans, 300
Africans, and 600 Sepoys, who, having expelled the inhabitants,
and covered the walls with cannon, were resolved to defend the
place to the last extremity. The failure of the supplies, which
Sir Eyre Coote had been led to expect from Madras by the fleet,
excited so much anxiety and disappointment in the veteran’s mind,
that a severe illness ensued, which obliged him to quit the army,
and ultimately to proceed to Bengal for the benefit of his health.
The command then devolved upon Major-General James Stuart, who
commenced his retreat in the evening of the 10th of October.

On the 15th of October, the monsoon set in with unusual severity,
and the army went into cantonments in the vicinity of Madras.
Hyder Ali, at the same time, took up his old position near Arcot.
Shortly after, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton, with a large
fleet from England, came to anchor in Madras roads, having on board
considerable reinforcements for the army, which was joined in the
cantonments by the Twenty-third Light Dragoons, the 101st and
102d British regiments, and the Fifteenth regiment of Hanoverian
Infantry.

In the month of December occurred the decease of that extraordinary
man, HYDER ALI, who was succeeded, without any of the commotions
usual in the East on such occasions, by his son, TIPPOO SAIB, to
whom he left a kingdom of his own acquisition, which made him one
of the most powerful princes in India.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

All ordinary means of attack appearing to be unavailing against the
resolute garrison of Gibraltar (of which the second battalion of
the regiment formed part), stupendous preparations were made on a
new principle, and floating batteries were constructed with great
art and labour. These were accounted the most perfect contrivance
of the kind ever seen. The combined power of France and Spain was
directed against the fortress. The Duke of Crillon assumed the
command of the besieging army, and was assisted by a celebrated
French engineer, Monsieur d’Arcon, and by Admiral Moreno, and a
French army arrived to take part in the siege.

A crisis was evidently approaching, and in the spring and summer
of 1782 the garrison of Gibraltar made preparations with cool
determination for the hour of trial. The officers and soldiers
appeared to be impressed with their peculiar situation; an
important fortress was confided to their protection; they had
defended it against the efforts of the Spanish army and navy
upwards of two years; and the eyes of all Europe were directed
towards them. The damaged works were carefully repaired, new ones
were constructed, extensive subterraneous works were prepared, and
forges for heating red-hot shot were got ready. Every serjeant,
drummer, musician, and officer’s servant, as well as the corporals
and private soldiers, used a shovel, pickaxe, or musket, according
as their services were required. The effect of the red-hot shot was
proved on some of the enemy’s wooden batteries on the sands, which
were speedily destroyed.

The Duke of Crillon anticipated the most signal success from the
extensive preparations he was making. His camp was visited by
princes of the royal blood of France, by Spanish nobility, and
other dignified characters of Europe, who came to be spectators of
the fall of the fortress, under the heavy fire of artillery which
was about to be opened upon it. The new batteries on shore were
unmasked, and fired a volley of sixty shells, which was followed
by the thunder of one hundred and seventy guns of large calibre.
Thus was Gibraltar assailed by a storm of iron, which threatened
to reduce the fortress to a heap of ruins, and this was only a
prelude to the tremendous fire which was afterwards opened upon the
garrison. Lieutenant Phipps Wharton, of the second battalion, was
dangerously wounded by the enemy’s fire.

On the 13th of September, the ten battering ships took their
station before the fortress, in the presence of the combined fleets
of France and Spain. The enemy’s camp and neighbouring hills were
crowded with spectators from various parts of Europe, to witness
the effect of these stupendous vessels, and such a storm of war was
opened upon the garrison as was probably never heard before since
the invention of cannon. The batteries of the fortress answered
this tremendous fire with vigour, and the deafening thunder of four
hundred pieces of heavy artillery was heard for many miles. For
some hours the attack and defence were so equally well supported as
scarcely to admit any appearance of superiority in the cannonade
on either side. The wonderful construction of the battering ships
seemed to bid defiance to the heaviest ordnance; shells rebounded
from their tops, and a thirty-two pound shot scarcely seemed to
make any impression on them. The effect of the red-hot shot was
doubted; sometimes smoke came from the ships, but the fire-engines
within soon occasioned it to cease, and the result was uncertain.
The fire was, however, persevered in, and incessant showers of
red-hot bullets, shells, and carcases flew through the air. In the
afternoon the effects of the red-hot shot became apparent, and
volumes of smoke issued from the flag-ship; the Admiral’s second
ship was perceived to be in the same condition, and confusion
prevailed. The Spaniards expected that the firing of red-hot
bullets could not be persevered in beyond a few rounds; but the
fire was continued with the same precision and vivacity as cold
shot. The effects of the hot balls occasioned the enemy’s cannonade
to abate, and about eight o’clock it almost totally ceased. The
battering ships made signals to inform the combined fleets of
their extreme danger and distress, and several boats were sent to
their aid. At this period the fire of the garrison produced great
carnage, and the most pitiable cries and groans were heard, as the
incessant showers of shot and shells were poured into the floating
batteries. Soon after midnight one ship was in flames, and by
two o’clock she appeared one sheet of fire from head to stern; a
second was soon in the same state; the flames enabled the British
artillery to point their guns with precision, and soon after
three o’clock six more ships exhibited the effects of the red-hot
shot. The burning ships exhibited one of the grandest spectacles
of destruction ever beheld; and amidst this dreadful scene of
conflagration, the British seamen in boats were seen endeavouring
to rescue the Spaniards from the blazing ships. They preserved
between three and four hundred; and while they were thus engaged,
one of the ships blew up with a dreadful explosion; four others met
the same fate before seven o’clock, and another shortly afterwards,
and the remainder burnt to the water’s edge, their magazines having
been inundated; not one could be preserved as a trophy.

Thus did the mighty efforts of France and Spain end in defeat
and destruction, and the gallant efforts of the brave soldiers
who defended Gibraltar elicited the admiration of the nations in
Europe. In England the most enthusiastic applause was universal;
illuminations and other modes of testifying the joy of the people
followed the receipt of the news of the destruction of the boasted
invincible battering ships, and every family which could claim
a defender of Gibraltar belonging to it was proud of the honor.
The loss of the garrison, on the 13th and 14th of September, was
limited to one officer, two serjeants, and thirteen rank and file
killed; five officers and sixty-three rank and file wounded; that
of the enemy exceeded two thousand officers and soldiers. Captain
Alexander Mackenzie, of the second battalion, was one of the
officers wounded.

Although the enemy gave up all hopes of reducing Gibraltar by
force of arms, yet some expectation was entertained, that, if the
blockade was continued, the garrison might be forced to surrender
from the want of provisions; the combined fleet therefore remained
in the bay, the besieging army continued in the lines, and about
a thousand shots were fired every day from the Spanish batteries.
The garrison was encouraged to continue resolute in the defence of
the fortress by assurances of their Sovereign’s favour and high
approbation. The principal Secretary of State, writing to General
Eliott, stated,--“I am honored with His Majesty’s commands to
assure you, in the strongest terms, that no encouragement shall be
wanting to the brave officers and soldiers under your command. His
royal approbation of the past will no doubt be a powerful incentive
to future exertions, and I have the King’s authority to assure
you, that every distinguished act of emulation and gallantry,
which shall be performed in the course of the siege by any, even
of the lowest rank, will meet with ample reward from his gracious
protection and favour.”

On the 4th of October Lieutenant Kenneth Mackenzie, of the second
battalion, was wounded in the communication from the King’s to the
Queen’s lines.

In October the combined fleet was much damaged by a storm, and
soon afterwards a British naval force arrived, and the garrison
was again relieved, when two regiments, the Twenty-fifth and
Fifty-ninth, landed to take part in the defence of the fortress.

On the 23d of November Lieutenant John Mackenzie, of the second
battalion, was dangerously wounded by the enemy’s cannonade.

[Sidenote: 1783.]

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

At the opening of the campaign of 1783, Tippoo Saib encamped his
army upon the plains of Arnee, where he was joined by a strong
detachment of French auxiliaries from Cuddalore.

Major-General Stuart put the British army in movement, having first
in view the demolition of the useless fortresses of Wandewash and
Carangooly. He arrived at the latter place on the 6th of February,
and, leaving there all heavy baggage and encumbrances, proceeded
lightly equipped towards Wandewash, the works of which were
accordingly destroyed. The army then returned to Carangooly, which
experienced the same fate as Wandewash, and on the 23d of February
arrived at Poonamallee.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

Meanwhile, the siege of Gibraltar had terminated, hostilities
having ceased in February 1783, in consequence of the preliminaries
of the treaties between Great Britain, France, and Spain having
been signed at Versailles on the 20th of the preceding month. The
second battalion during the siege was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
the Honorable George Mackenzie.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

Notwithstanding private information having been received from
respectable sources, overland, of a peace having been concluded
between Great Britain and the other belligerent powers in
Europe, still the Madras Government was determined to persevere
in its original plans for the attack of _Cuddalore_. With this
view, Major-General Stuart put the army in movement on the
21st of April, marching by brigades in a southerly direction.
Major-General Stuart’s army consisted of the present SEVENTY-FIRST
and Seventy-second regiments, the 101st regiment, a considerable
body of native troops, and a detachment of Hanoverians under
Colonel Wangenheim. Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston, of the first
battalion of the regiment, took the lead, with the fifth brigade,
to the command of which he had been appointed, in consideration of
his distinguished conduct and important services in the field.

Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart, of the Seventy-eighth Highlanders (the
present Seventy-second regiment), commanded the first or European
brigade, of which the first battalion of the _Seventy-third_ (now
the SEVENTY-FIRST) regiment formed part, and which amounted to
sixteen hundred men.

Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston, in his advance, possessed himself
of Permacoil ruins, from whence could be plainly distinguished the
enemy’s advanced parties upon the Red Hills of Pondicherry. The
remainder of the army joined at Permacoil on the 2d of May.

About this period accounts were received of the decease of
Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, which intelligence threw a peculiar
gloom over those officers and men who had had the honor to serve
under his command in India. Major-General Stuart succeeded to the
command of the forces in India for the time being.

After leaving Permacoil, the army advanced to Killinoor, and from
thence directed its course towards the Red Hills of Pondicherry.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

In May 1783, the second battalion embarked in transports, and
sailed from Gibraltar for Portsmouth, where it landed in July
following.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

On the 4th of June, Major-General Stuart placed the British camp
close to the Pannar River, about five miles west of _Cuddalore_,
behind which the French army was descried in an entrenched camp.

The British crossed the Pannar River on the 6th of June, without
being molested, passed the Bandipollam Hills, and took up a strong
position not more than two miles from the south face of the
fortress of _Cuddalore_, having their right flank covered by the
sea, and the left by the Bandipollam Hills. The enemy, commanded
by General de Bussy, had in the meantime been occupied in throwing
up works along his front.

On the 12th of June, Major-General Stuart had determined upon
attacking Monsieur de Bussy in his present position, and issued
preparatory orders accordingly. At four o’clock in the morning
of the 13th of June, the action commenced by a movement from the
British left upon the right flank of the enemy. A very obstinate
and sanguinary contest ensued, and continued without intermission
until the evening, when both armies remained upon the field of
battle, and consequently each claimed the victory.

In this action the first battalion of the regiment highly
distinguished itself, having wrested from the enemy, in the course
of the conflict, seven different redoubts. The loss sustained by
the battalion was very severe, amounting in killed and wounded to
13 officers and 272 men, being one half of the gross number in
the field. The battalion in this action was commanded by Captain
Hugh Lamont. The battalion had to regret the loss of Captains the
Honorable James Lindsay and Alexander Mackenzie, who were killed.
The former officer commanded the Grenadier company.

The following flattering compliment formed part of the general
orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief at the conclusion of the
battle:--“I am also grateful to Captain Lamont and the officers
under his command, who gallantly led the _precious remains_ of the
SEVENTY-THIRD Regiment through the most perilous road to glory,
until exactly one half of the officers and men of the battalion
were either killed or wounded.”

On the 17th of June the English and French fleets fought their last
battle during this war. The former commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir
Edward Hughes, and the latter by Monsieur Suffrein. The contest was
perfectly in view of both armies. The result obliged the British
admiral to proceed to Madras, while, to the great embarrassment
of the army under Major-General Stuart, the French fleet was
enabled to anchor in Cuddalore Roads, and to afford supplies and
reinforcements to their troops.

The British prosecuted the siege of Cuddalore with vigour, and on
the 25th of June the first parallel was completed. On that day the
enemy made a _sortie_ but was repulsed, after a severe contest,
with considerable loss. The commander of the party, Colonel the
Chevalier de Damas, was among the prisoners taken on this occasion.

On the 1st of July a frigate arrived in Cuddalore Roads, confirming
the former intelligence, and bringing the official accounts from
England of a general peace having been concluded. Hostilities in
consequence ceased. The English and French interchanged visits,
congratulations, and compliments, and became apparently as cordial
friends as they had before been determined enemies.

By the 2d of August the British army had received the supplies of
which it stood greatly in want, and the camp was immediately broken
up, the troops proceeding towards Madras, where they arrived on the
16th of that month, at St. Thomas’s Mount.

The army shortly afterwards went into winter quarters, the
SEVENTY-THIRD occupying the fort and cantonment of Arcot.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

In August the second battalion marched from Hilsea barracks to
Stirling, where it was disbanded on the 3d of October; and the
officers belonging to the second battalion, who were regimentally
senior to those serving with the first, had the option afforded
them of joining that battalion in the East Indies, at their own
expense, of which some availed themselves.

[Sidenote: 1784.]

On the 11th of March 1784, a general peace was ratified between
the Honorable East India Company and Tippoo Saib, and, shortly
afterwards, the officers and men, who had been made prisoners
in the action fought by Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, on the 10th of
September 1780, were restored to their friends, after having
endured captivity in irons in an ungenial climate, and most of them
suffering from severe wounds.

The regiment had the gratification to receive Captains David Baird
and the Honorable John Lindsay. The commission of the latter, as
captain, had been antedated to the 12th of September 1780. Both of
these officers had recovered from their wounds.

During the remainder of the year the regiment continued at Arcot,
and was only employed, beyond the usual routine of duty in
quarters, for a short time in quelling a mutiny which broke out
in the native cavalry at Arnee. The regiment at this period was
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel William Dalrymple.

[Sidenote: 1785.]

In the course of the month of June the regiment was removed from
Arcot to Fort St. George at Madras, where it was joined by certain
officers of the late second battalion. Lieut.-Colonel Dalrymple
having returned to Great Britain, the regiment was commanded by
Brevet Colonel the Honorable George Mackenzie.

The regiment continued in quarters during the remainder of the year
at Fort St. George, and in the town at Madras.

[Sidenote: 1786.]

In the year 1786 the numerical title of the regiment was changed
from Seventy-third to SEVENTY-FIRST; and new colours were received
from England, bearing the number SEVENTY-FIRST, which designation
it has since retained.

The regiment changed its quarters, in March, to Wallajohabad and
Chingleput, having nine companies cantoned at the former station,
and one at the latter under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton Maxwell.

[Sidenote: 1787.]

On the 4th of June 1787, the commanding officer, Colonel the
Honorable George Mackenzie, died, after a short illness. His body
was sent to Madras, and there interred with the military honors
due to his rank. The senior major, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel John
Elphinston, succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy and to the
command of the regiment. Captain David Baird was at the same time
promoted to the rank of major. The commissions of these officers
were dated 5th of June 1787.

During the year 1787 no change of quarters took place, and the
regiment remained in cantonments at Wallajohabad and Chingleput.

[Sidenote: 1788.]

In February 1788, in consequence of some disturbance or alarm at
the Bombay Presidency, the SEVENTY-FIRST marched to Madras, and
immediately embarked on board the Company’s ships for Bombay. The
regiment was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston, and was about
eight hundred strong.

After a favorable passage, the ships arrived at Bombay in
April, when the regiment immediately disembarked and went into
barracks, where it remained for six months. The Seventy-fifth and
Seventy-seventh regiments having, in this interval, arrived at
Bombay from England, the services of the SEVENTY-FIRST became no
longer necessary at that Presidency, and the regiment proceeded in
October to Madras, where it arrived in December.

Five companies, under Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston, occupied the
barracks in Fort St. George, and the other five companies proceeded
to Poonamallee.

[Sidenote: 1789.]

Major-General the Honorable William Gordon was appointed colonel of
the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment on the 9th of April 1789, in succession
to Major-General John Lord Macleod, deceased.

In the course of the year 1789, the five companies at Poonamallee
were removed to Tripassoor.

[Sidenote: 1790.]

On the 16th of March 1790, the companies at Madras and Tripassoor
received orders to join a force which was assembling at
Wallajohabad, under the orders of Colonel Thomas Musgrave, of the
Seventy-sixth, in consequence of the hostilities which Tippoo Saib
had commenced against the Rajah of Travancore, a faithful British
ally. The SEVENTY-FIRST arrived at Wallajohabad on the 18th of
March, and joined the other troops, consisting of the nineteenth
light dragoons, fifty-second, and SEVENTY-FIRST regiments, the
third and fourth native cavalry, the first battalion of coast
artillery, and the second, fourth, ninth, fourteenth, and
twenty-fifth coast sepoys.

This force was put in movement on the 29th of March, and proceeded
towards Trichinopoly, which it did not reach until the 29th of
April, and found there the following corps, under the command
of Colonel Brydges:--two King’s regiments, the thirty-sixth and
seventy-second; the second and fifth native cavalry; the first,
fifth, sixth, seventh, sixteenth, twentieth, and twenty-third
coast sepoys. At the same time Colonel Deare, with three companies
of Bengal artillery, joined, the whole being under the orders of
Major-General Musgrave, to which rank he had been promoted on the
28th of April 1790.

The army was immediately divided into brigades and wings;
Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart, of the Seventy-second Highlanders,
was appointed to command the left wing, and Colonel Brydges, of
the East India Company’s service, the right; the SEVENTY-FIRST and
seventy-second regiments, and first East India Company’s European
battalion, formed the second European brigade, under Lieut.-Colonel
Clarke, of the Company’s service.

The whole of the cavalry and the advance were commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel, afterwards General Sir John Floyd, of the
nineteenth light dragoons, since disbanded.

On the 24th of May, Major-General (afterwards Sir William) Medows
assumed the command, and reviewed the army, which on the 26th of
that month was put in movement towards the Coimbatore country.

The army reached Caroor, a fortified place, on the 15th of
June, which the enemy abandoned on the approach of the British,
who remained in this position, strengthening Caroor, and
collecting grain, until the 2d of July, when they moved for
Arrivacourchy, arriving there on the 5th, and continuing their
route by Tooramboddy, arrived on the 10th of July at Daraporam.
At this latter place was found a large supply of grain and other
necessaries, which had been left by the enemy.

During the march to Coimbatore, where the British arrived on the
22d of July, Tippoo’s irregular horse were very active in hovering
around, for the purpose of picking up stragglers and baggage.

The army halted at Coimbatore, and detachments were sent off to
reduce Dindigul, Errode, and _Palghautcherry_. The flank companies
of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, commanded by Captains Phineas
M^cIntosh and James Robertson, were employed upon the latter
service. In August the whole of the cavalry and the advance had
been pushed forward to the Boovany, near to the Gudzelhetty Pass.
Tippoo Saib, profiting by the divided state of the British force,
descended with his whole army, and after a very severe conflict
obliged Lieut.-Colonel Floyd to fall back. The troops from
Coimbatore had marched to his support, and on the junction being
effected, Tippoo retired. The British returned to Coimbatore on the
23d of September.

Upon the march of the main body, the flank companies of the
SEVENTY-FIRST and Seventy-second were withdrawn from the siege
of _Palghautcherry_, and ordered to take post in the fort of
Coimbatore; and on the return of the army they rejoined the
regiment.

The army was again put in motion on the 29th of September,
proceeding towards the Boovany by Shawoor and Coopachitty-pollum,
where the troops arrived a few hours after Tippoo had left it. Some
elephants, bullocks, and camels loaded with rockets, fell into the
hands of the British.

On the 4th of October the army arrived at Errode, the enemy keeping
a respectful distance during the march; and on the 6th of that
month it was ascertained that he had arrived with his whole force
at _Darraporam_, against which he opened his batteries on the 8th.
The fort had no cannon mounted, and the garrison, consisting of a
hundred Europeans and two hundred sepoys, capitulated on honorable
terms, to which the enemy strictly adhered.

The British army moved on the 5th of October, and on the 15th
encamped in the neighbourhood of Coimbatore, where Lieut.-Colonel
Stuart joined from _Palghautcherry_, after having taken the place,
and left it in a tolerable state of defence. On the 20th of
October, all the heavy baggage having been deposited in the fort
of Coimbatore, the army recommenced moving, directing its march
towards Errode, by Avinochy and Perentore, where it arrived on the
2d of November. On the 8th the army proceeded in the direction of
Bovaneore, and thence to a ford about three miles below Errode,
the whole crossing the Cavery on the 9th and 10th, while Tippoo
marched with his entire force to attack a division under the
orders of Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton Maxwell, of the Seventy-fourth
Regiment, then in the Bharamahl country. On the 11th of November
the army moved by Sankerrydroog for the Tappoor Pass, and ascended
on the 14th, encamping at Adamancottah, in the Bharamahl country;
marched again on the 15th, and on the 17th effected a junction
with Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell at Darrampoury. This officer had
under his orders the Seventy-fourth and Seventy-sixth King’s
regiments, the fourth battalion of Madras Europeans, the third,
seventh, thirteenth, fourteenth, twenty-first, twenty-sixth, and
twenty-seventh Bengal sepoys.

The Seventy-fourth joined the SEVENTY-FIRST and Seventy-second
Regiments in the second brigade; and Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell assumed
the command of the left wing in the place of Colonel Brydges, who
was appointed to command at Trichinopoly.

On the 18th of November the army moved by Coveriporum to the
Tappoor Pass, when the advance fell in with the rear of Tippoo’s
force, but could make no impression.

It was now ascertained that the enemy, whose movements were always
sudden, varied, and perplexing, was directing his course to the
Carnatic by Namacul and Trichinopoly. The British in consequence
pursued by Malusundrum, arriving on the 23d at Vavoor; the 27th at
Jaloor; on the 6th of December at Munsarapett; and at Terany on the
31st of December.

[Sidenote: 1791.]

On the 1st of January 1791 the army arrived at Terrimungulum, and
on the 12th at Arnee.

During this long and fatiguing march, the Anglo-Indian troops
frequently encamped upon the ground from which the enemy had
removed in the morning, but the efforts made to overtake him were
not successful. The sick and heavy guns having been placed in the
fort of Arnee, on the 14th of January the advance and right wing
marched for Velhout, where they arrived on the 27th, followed by
the left wing.

On the 29th of January the army was reviewed by General Charles the
Earl Cornwallis, K.G., who had arrived from Bengal to assume the
command, and who expressed great satisfaction at the appearance of
the troops. His lordship was at this period Governor-General and
Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies, and had quitted Bengal on
the 6th of December of the previous year, and landed at Fort St.
George, Madras, on the 30th of the same month.

In the course of the foregoing campaign the SEVENTY-FIRST Regiment
lost few men in action, but many fell victims to climate and
fatigue.

The army, being refreshed and equipped, commenced moving in a
westerly direction on the 5th of February, by Perambaukum and
Sholingur, arriving on the 11th in the vicinity of Vellore. The
troops were ordered into the fort, and on the 14th they marched
to Chittipet, turning suddenly to the right by Chittoor towards
the Muglee Pass, where they arrived on the 17th of February. On
the 18th the advance, followed by the park and stores, ascended
the ghauts, the whole army encamping on the day following at
Palamnaire, in the Mysore country, without having seen anything of
the enemy.

During the time the British army remained at Velhout, Tippoo pushed
to the southward, and summoned Cuddalore, but upon learning in
what direction Earl Cornwallis had moved, the Sultan hastened to
the Shangana Pass, where he arrived too late to oppose the troops
at the Muglee Pass. On the 24th, the British marched for Colar,
which was abandoned on their approach; from thence the army moved
to Ouscotta, which place was immediately carried by a battalion of
sepoys.

The enemy displayed a part of his force on the 4th of March, and on
the following day opened a cannonade upon the troops moving towards
_Bangalore_, whilst his horse attempted to attack the stores and
baggage, but without success. About sunset on the 5th of March, the
army encamped within shot of the fort of Bangalore, and shifted its
ground on the day following. The pettah (the suburbs of the town)
was then attacked by the thirty-sixth and seventy-sixth regiments,
with some battalions of sepoys, and carried, after a very resolute
resistance on the part of the defenders.

From this period to the 14th of March, nothing material occurred,
but every preparation for the approaching siege was carried on with
diligence and activity. On the 15th, the batteries being completed,
opened a fire upon Bangalore; and on the 17th the lines were
cannonaded by the enemy, while at night the camp was much disturbed
by his rockets.

Forage became very scarce, and none could be procured beyond the
advanced piquets. The siege, however, proceeded, and the enemy
continued to harass the British until the 21st March, when the
breach being considered practicable, an attack was ordered.

The storming party consisted of the grenadiers of the thirty-sixth,
fifty-second, SEVENTY-FIRST, seventy-second, seventy-fourth,
and seventy-sixth regiments, followed by their respective light
companies, and led by Lieutenant James Duncan of the SEVENTY-FIRST,
and Lieutenant John Evans of the fifty-second, with a forlorn
hope of thirty chosen men; the whole supported by the battalion
companies of the thirty-sixth, seventy-second, and seventy-sixth,
with some battalions of Bengal sepoys. The corps of attack were
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell of the seventy-fourth; the
flankers immediately by Major Skelly; Major-General Medows was
present on the occasion.

The grenadier company of the SEVENTY-FIRST was commanded by
Captain the Honorable John Lindsay, who, upon entering the breach,
directed his men to throw away their priming, and trust entirely to
their bayonets. The light company was commanded by Captain James
Robertson, son of the celebrated historian.

With the aid of scaling ladders, and after encountering very
formidable obstacles, _Bangalore_ was carried. From the 6th of
March to the conquest of Bangalore, the SEVENTY-FIRST had six
privates killed, and fourteen wounded.

On the 28th of March, a strong garrison being left in Bangalore,
the army moved to Deonhully, the birthplace of Hyder Ali, where it
arrived on the 30th, and on the 1st of April at Chinnaballaporam,
both of which places were abandoned by the enemy. The army
reached Connapelly on the 12th of April, and on the following day
effected a junction with the Nizam’s force, which had been sent to
co-operate with the British, and which amounted to about fifteen
thousand cavalry.

The army arrived at Venkatagherry, on the 18th of April, where
a large detachment of Europeans, under Colonel Oldham, joined
from the Carnatic, and on the 22d of April again encamped near
Bangalore. During this march, the object of which was chiefly to
procure supplies, the enemy’s irregular horse were now and then
seen in small detached bodies.

The British commenced their march on the 4th of May towards
_Seringapatam_, the capital of Tippoo Saib’s territory, and on
the 13th of that month arrived at Arakerry, on the Cavery, about
eight miles below Seringapatam, which derived its name from the god
_Serung_, to whom one of the pagodas was dedicated. The enemy was
discernible in front, with his right resting on the river, and his
left on a high hill named the Carighaut.

During the night of the 14th of May the troops marched with a view
to surprise the enemy, but owing to the badness of the weather and
roads, together with the jaded state of the gun-bullocks, little
or no progress was made during the night; but on the following
day, after having undergone great fatigue, they were brought into
action, when the enemy was driven from his strong position, and
forced across the river into the island upon which the capital,
Seringapatam, is situated, where he was protected by his batteries.

In this affair four guns and several standards were taken. The
SEVENTY-FIRST had Lieutenant and Adjutant Roderick Mackenzie and
seven rank and file killed; Ensign John Stuart and seventy-four
rank and file were wounded.

The army rested upon the field of battle, and was again in movement
on the 18th of May, and arrived on the 20th at Canambaddy,
situated on the Cavery, some miles above Seringapatam. It was now
ascertained that the season was too far advanced for undertaking
immediately the siege of Tippoo’s capital, and it was determined
accordingly to withdraw. The battering train was destroyed; all the
ammunition and stores were buried, which could not be removed, and
on the 26th of May the army marched in the direction of Bangalore.

Before commencing their retreat, the soldiers were thanked
in orders for their conduct throughout these services; and
it was added:--“So long as there were any hopes of reducing
_Seringapatam_ before the commencement of the heavy rains, the
Commander-in-chief thought himself happy in availing himself of
their willing services; but the unexpected bad weather, for some
time experienced, having rendered the attack of the enemy’s capital
impracticable, until the conclusion of the ensuing monsoons, Lord
Cornwallis thought he should make an ill return for the zeal and
alacrity exhibited by the soldiers, if he desired them to draw the
guns and stores back to a magazine, where there remains an ample
supply of both, which was captured by their valour; he did not,
therefore, hesitate to order the guns and stores which were not
wanted for field service to be destroyed.”

In the course of this retreat the British were joined by the
Mahratta army, under Hurry Punt and Purseram Bhow, consisting of
about thirty-two thousand men, chiefly cavalry, and thirty pieces
of cannon. Of the approach of this large force, the British had
been kept in total ignorance, by the active manner in which the
communications were interrupted by Tippoo’s irregular troops.
Captain Little, having under his orders two battalions of Bombay
sepoys, joined with the Mahratta army, and the supplies were now
abundant.

On the 11th of July, after marching by Alcotta, Goodyanelly,
Outredroog, and Sankerrydroog, the army arrived at Bangalore.

The enemy made no attempt whatever to interrupt the march. By this
time the Nizam’s cavalry had become unfit to keep the field, and
were allowed to return to their own country. Purseram Bhow also,
with a large detachment of the Mahrattas, proceeded into the Sera
country; but Hurry Punt, with the remainder, continued attached to
the British army. On the 15th of July the whole of the sick, and
one half of the tumbrils belonging to the field-pieces, were sent
into the fort of Bangalore, and the army moved towards Oussoor,
where it arrived on the 11th of the following month.

The fort of Oussoor was abandoned by the enemy, after he had
blown up the angles. In this place were found the bodies of three
Europeans who had been put to death by Tippoo’s orders. One of
these unfortunate persons, named Hamilton, had been an officer in
the British navy.

On the 12th of August the army moved from Oussoor, and on the 23d
arrived at Bayeur. About this period Major Gowdie, of the Honorable
East India Company’s Service, was detached with some troops for the
reduction of the strong hill fort of _Nundydroog_, which it was
found required regular approaches.

The flank companies of the thirty-sixth and SEVENTY-FIRST
regiments, under the command of Captain Robertson, of the latter
corps, marched on the 17th of October to join the detachment under
Major Gowdie, and, upon their arrival, were immediately placed in
the last parallel.

On the 18th of October, General the Earl Cornwallis, with the whole
army, made a movement towards _Nundydroog_, and in the evening
of that day the troops were told off for an assault upon the two
breaches, which had been pronounced practicable. The attacks
commenced at eleven o’clock at night, the grenadiers assaulting
the right breach, and the light companies the left. The forlorn
hope of the right attack consisted of twenty grenadiers, volunteers
from the thirty-sixth and SEVENTY-FIRST, led by Lieutenant Hugh
Mackenzie of the SEVENTY-FIRST, formerly paymaster of the regiment.
The same number of light infantry, headed by Lieutenant Lewis
Moore, of the SEVENTY-FIRST, formed the left attack. The grenadier
company of the regiment, in support, was commanded by Lieutenant
James Duncan; the light company, by Lieutenant Kenneth Mackenzie;
the whole under Captain Robertson’s orders, as before stated.

Captain Robert Burne supported, with the thirty-sixth grenadiers,
the right attack, and Captain William Hartley, with the light
company of that regiment, the left attack; Major-General Medows, as
usual, animating the whole with his presence.

Both breaches were carried without much resistance from the enemy,
and the gateway of the inner wall being soon secured, the fort fell
into the possession of the British. Many of the enemy were killed,
and several, in attempting to escape, were dashed to pieces over
the precipices. It was an additional source of gratification, that
this important service had been achieved without the loss of a
British soldier.

In a few days subsequently to the fall of Nundydroog, the army
retraced its route to Bangalore.

On the 4th of December the troops were again put in movement,
directing their march towards _Savendroog_, a fortress situated on
the side of a mountain, environed by almost inaccessible rocks.
The fort being reconnoitred, a detachment under Lieut.-Colonel
James Stuart, of the Seventy-second regiment, was selected, and
ordered to reduce the place. On the 17th the British were enabled
to open upon the fort a battery of six eighteen-pounders and three
twelve-pounders, with considerable effect.

The flank companies of the SEVENTY-FIRST and seventy-sixth
regiments joined the detachment under Lieut.-Colonel Stuart
on the 20th of December, and on the following day the flank
companies of the fifty-second, SEVENTY-FIRST, seventy-second, and
seventy-sixth, were selected for the attack upon _Savendroog_ (in
which a practicable breach had been effected), and formed under
Lieut.-Colonel Colebrook Nesbitt, of the fifty-second regiment.

The storming party, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Nesbitt, was
directed to four different attacks. Captain James Gage, with
the grenadiers of the fifty-second and flank companies of the
seventy-sixth regiment, to gain the eastern hill to the left;
Captain the Honorable William Monson, with the light company of
the fifty-second, to scour the works towards the western hill on
the right; Captain the Honorable John Lindsay and Captain James
Robertson, with the flank companies of the SEVENTY-FIRST, to
separate, and attack the works or parties they might discover
in the chasm or hollow between the hills; the fifty-second and
seventy-second regiments were to follow the flank companies;
parties were detached under Lieut.-Colonel Baird and Major Petrie
round the mountain, to draw the attention of the enemy from the
main object, and to endeavour to prevent his escape.

At eleven o’clock in the morning of the 21st of December, on
a signal of two guns being fired from the batteries, the flank
companies, in the order described, followed by the fifty-second and
seventy-second regiments, advanced to the assault; the band of the
fifty-second playing “_Britons, strike home!_” while the grenadiers
and light infantry mounted the breach.

Immediate success followed the attempt, the fort being carried
without the loss of a man. The troops were thanked in general
orders for their gallant conduct, in which it was stated,--

  “Lord Cornwallis thinks himself fortunate, almost beyond example,
  in having acquired by assault a fortress of so much strength and
  reputation, and of such inestimable value to the public interest,
  as Savendroog,[15] without having to regret the loss of a single
  soldier.”

In the course of a short time afterwards, the following places
surrendered, with trifling loss, to detachments of the British
army; namely, Outredroog, Ram Gurry, and Sheria Gurry.

The army subsequently moved towards Outredroog, a hill fort about
thirty miles west of Bangalore, where a general hospital was
established.

[Sidenote: 1792.]

On the 31st of January 1792 the army under General the Earl
Cornwallis was reviewed by the Poonah and Hyderabad chiefs, and
on the following day commenced its march towards _Seringapatam_,
passing by Hooleadroog, Tajilly, and Carrycode. The troops came in
sight of Tippoo’s capital on the 5th of February, and encamped at
the French Rocks. The enemy’s horse showed itself on the 4th and
5th, but attempted nothing hostile.

The entrenched camp of Tippoo was reconnoitred on the 6th of
February, and at dark the army was formed in three columns of
attack. The right, under Major General Medows, consisting of the
thirty-sixth and seventy-sixth King’s regiments. The centre,
under the Commander-in-chief, General the Earl Cornwallis,
consisting of the fifty-second, SEVENTY-FIRST, and seventy-fourth
King’s regiments. The left, under Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell of the
seventy-fourth, was composed of the seventy-second regiment. The
native troops were divided among the three columns.

By eight o’clock in the evening of the 6th of February the three
columns were in motion. The head of the centre column, led by the
flank companies of the respective corps, after twice crossing the
Lokany river, which covered the enemy’s right wing and front, came
in contact with his first line, and immediately forced through it.
The British flankers, mixing with the fugitives, crossed the north
branch of the Cavery, at the foot of the _glacis_ of the fort of
_Seringapatam_. Captain the Honorable John Lindsay collected the
grenadiers of the SEVENTY-FIRST upon the _glacis_, and attempted
to push into the body of the place, but was prevented by the
bridge being raised a few moments before he reached it. He was
soon after joined by some of the light company of the fifty-second
and grenadiers of the seventy-sixth, with whom he forced his way
down to the famous _Llal Baugh_, or “_Garden of Pearls_,” where he
was attacked most furiously, but the enemy was repelled in a very
spirited style with the bayonet.

Captain Lindsay was afterwards joined by the seventy-fourth
grenadiers, and attempted to drive the enemy from the Pettah, but
could not succeed, from the numbers which poured on him from all
sides. This gallant officer then took post in a redoubt, where
he maintained himself until morning, and then moved to the north
bank of the river, where the firing appeared very heavy. He was
there met by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel the Honorable John Knox,
of the thirty-sixth regiment, and by Lieut.-Colonel Baird, with
the grenadiers of the fifty-second, and the light company of the
SEVENTY-FIRST, together with some of the troops that composed the
left attack.

During these occurrences the battalion companies of the
fifty-second, SEVENTY-FIRST, and seventy-second regiments forced
their way across the river to the island, overpowering all that
opposed them, when Captain Archdeacon, commanding a battalion
of Bengal Sepoys, being killed, that battalion was thrown into
confusion, falling back upon the SEVENTY-FIRST. Major Stair Park
Dalrymple, wishing to prevent the Sepoys intermingling with his
men, ordered the regiment to oblique to the left, an operation
that by chance brought him in contact with the Sultan’s redoubt,
which was instantly attacked and carried. The charge of the redoubt
was given to Captain Hugh Sibbald, of the SEVENTY-FIRST, with his
company, who on the following morning was killed, nobly defending
it against repeated and desperate attacks from the enemy. The
commander-in-chief, General the Earl Cornwallis, in compliment to
the memory of this officer, had the name of the redoubt changed to
“Sibbald.”

In the evening of the 7th of February three thousand of the enemy’s
horse attacked the British troops on the island, but were repulsed
by the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment and the first Coast Sepoys. In
the course of these operations the regiment had Captain Sibbald
and Lieutenant Daniel Bayne killed; Ensign Duncan Mackenzie was
wounded; about one hundred rank and file were killed and wounded.

The enemy’s loss was very severe, being estimated at 20,000
_hors-de-combat_. Eighty pieces of cannon were taken by the British.

On the 9th of February the army took up its final position for
the siege of _Seringapatam_, and on the 15th Major-General Robert
Abercromby joined with the Bombay force, consisting of the
seventy-third, seventy-fifth, and seventy-seventh regiments,
besides native troops, making a total of about 6,000 men.

The SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, commanded by Major Dalrymple, crossed
the south branch of the Cavery at nine o’clock at night on the 18th
of February, and in two hours after attacked by surprise a camp
of the enemy’s cavalry, of whom great part were slain, and the
remainder dispersed in all directions. This movement was designed
to cover the operation of opening the trenches, which took place at
the same time, within eight hundred yards of the fort.

Until the 24th of February the approaches were carried on with
the greatest activity, when the general orders announced that the
preliminary articles of peace had been signed, and in consequence
all hostile measures immediately ceased.

On the 26th of February the two sons of Tippoo Saib, Abdel Kalek
and Mooza-ud-Deen, the former ten years of age, and the latter
eight, were brought to the British camp, as hostages for the due
performance of the preliminary articles.[16]

In consequence of some obstacles which had been opposed by Tippoo
to the arrangement of the definitive treaty, working parties were
ordered, and the guns replaced in the batteries on the 10th March.
This state of suspicion and preparation lasted until the 15th of
March, when it was discontinued, and on the 18th of that month, the
definitive treaty being duly executed, and signed, was delivered
by the young Abdel Kalek to each of the confederates. On the 20th
the counterpart was sent off to Tippoo Saib.

Thus terminated a war in which the confederates wrested from the
enemy seventy fortresses, eight hundred pieces of cannon, and
destroyed or dispersed at least fifty thousand men. By the articles
of the treaty, Tippoo was bound to pay a large sum of money, and to
cede one half of his dominions.

The Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in India granted from
this money a sum equal to six months’ batta for all ranks, and the
Court of Directors afterwards made a similar grant.

On the 26th of March, the exchange of the definitive treaty being
completed, the British commenced moving towards Bangalore, from
whence they proceeded to the Pednaigdurgum Pass, where the Bengal
troops were ordered to their own presidency.

Early in May the army descended the Ghauts, arriving soon after at
Vellore, where the Commander-in-Chief arranged the cantonments of
the troops, and proceeded to Madras. The SEVENTY-FIRST received
orders to march to the southward, and in the month of June arrived
at Warriore, near Trichinopoly, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Baird, who during the campaign had been absent from the regiment in
command of a brigade. Eight companies were stationed at Warriore,
and two were detached with Major Dalrymple to Dindigul. In this
situation the regiment continued for the remainder of the year.

[Sidenote: 1793.]

In March 1793, the eight companies under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Baird proceeded from Warriore to Secundermally, in
the neighbourhood of Madura. Meanwhile the events of the French
revolution had involved England in another contest, the National
Convention of France having declared war against Great Britain
and Holland, in February 1793. The news of this event arrived in
India in May following, when the siege of the French settlement
of _Pondicherry_, on the Coromandel coast, was determined upon.
Lieut.-Colonel Baird, of the SEVENTY-FIRST, was appointed to
command a brigade on this service.

In July the flank companies of the regiment were ordered to join
the force about to besiege _Pondicherry_, and marched for that
purpose, being followed soon afterwards by the battalion companies.
The place surrendered on the 22d of August, and the SEVENTY-FIRST
returned to Secundermally and Dindigul, where the regiment
continued during the remainder of the year.

[Sidenote: 1794.]

An attack upon the Mauritius was in contemplation at the
commencement of the year 1794, and troops for that service were
assembled at Wallajohabad. The SEVENTY-FIRST, having received
orders to join this force, marched to Wallajohabad, where the
regiment remained only a short time, having been ordered to return
to the southward, in consequence of the projected expedition being
relinquished.

The regiment marched accordingly, and arrived at Tanjore in June,
where it was stationed for the remainder of the year, having two
companies detached, under Major Dalrymple, at Vellum.

[Sidenote: 1795.]

Holland became united to France in the early part of 1795, and was
styled the Batavian republic. Upon the arrival of this information
in India, an expedition was fitted out against the island of
_Ceylon_, where the Dutch had several settlements. Major Dalrymple,
with the flank companies, marched to the coast, and embarked at
Negapatam, for the purpose of co-operating with the troops destined
for Ceylon, under the command of Colonel James Stuart, of the
seventy-second, who was promoted to the rank of Major-General at
this period. The fleet arrived on the coast of Ceylon on the 1st of
August, and two days afterwards the troops landed four miles north
of the fort of _Trincomalee_. The siege of the fort was commenced
as soon as the artillery and stores could be landed, and removed
sufficiently near to the place. On the 26th of August a practicable
breach was effected, and the garrison surrendered. The fort of
_Batticaloe_ surrendered on the 18th of September, and the fort and
island of _Manaar_ capitulated on the 5th of October. After these
services were performed, the flank companies returned to Tanjore in
the month of October, having lost eleven men in killed and wounded.
Captain William Charles Gorrie, of the grenadier company, was
desperately wounded in this expedition.

[Sidenote: 1796.]

In May 1796, the regiment marched to Wallajohabad, where it was
stationed during the remainder of the year.

[Sidenote: 1797.]

On the 2d of January 1797, the regiment was inspected by
Major-General Clarke, who issued the following general order:--

  “Major-General Clarke has experienced infinite satisfaction, this
  morning, at the review of His Majesty’s SEVENTY-FIRST regiment.

  “He cannot say that on any occasion of field exercise he ever was
  present at a more perfect performance.

  “When a corps is so striking in appearance, and so complete
  in every branch of its discipline, little can occur to the
  Commander-in-chief to particularize. He cannot but notice, however,
  that the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment has excited his admiration for its
  expertness in those parts of its exercise which are most essential,
  and most difficult to execute. He alludes to its order and
  regularity when moving in line; its extreme accuracy in preserving
  distances, and the neatness and promptitude that are so evident in
  all its formations. So much perfection in a corps, whose services
  in India will long be held in remembrance does the greatest honor
  to Lieut.-Colonel Baird and all his officers, to whom, and the
  corps at large, the Commander-in-chief desires to offer his best
  thanks.”

The regiment remained in the cantonment of Wallajohabad until
the month of October, when orders were issued for its return to
Europe. It was accordingly drafted, giving five hundred men to
the seventy-third and seventy-fourth regiments, and then marched
from Wallajohabad, under the command of Colonel Baird, with the
non-commissioned officers, drummers, and invalids, to Madras, and
immediately embarked on board of Indiamen for Great Britain. The
fleet sailed from Madras Roads on the 17th of October, and was at
sea during the remainder of the year.[17]

[Sidenote: 1798.]

Early in January 1798, the fleet arrived at the Cape of Good Hope,
where the commanding officer of the regiment, Colonel Baird, was
detained upon the staff, having been appointed brigadier-general.
After remaining a few days in Table Bay, the fleet sailed, and
reached St. Helena in February, where it was detained three months
waiting for a convoy.

The fleet sailed on the 1st of May from St. Helena, without
a convoy, and in July, in consequence of contrary winds, was
compelled to put into Cork Harbour. It sailed from thence for the
Thames, and on the 12th of August the regiment disembarked at
Woolwich, where it remained for a few days, and then re-embarked
in smacks for Leith. After landing, the regiment proceeded to
Stirling. As a mark of indulgence, a general leave for two months
was granted to the officers and men of the SEVENTY-FIRST, to
enable them to visit their friends and families, after a long
absence from their native country. At the expiration of this
period, the whole assembled at Stirling, with the addition of
several recruits. Immediately afterwards, the whole of the officers
and non-commissioned officers, with the exception of the staff, and
a few at head-quarters, were sent out to recruit the regiment.

[Sidenote: 1799.]

During the year 1799, the head-quarters remained at Stirling, and
the recruiting went on but slowly.

[Sidenote: 1800.]

In May 1800, the strength of the regiment amounted to about two
hundred rank and file, when a route arrived changing the quarters
to Paisley, but soon after the march an order arrived for its
proceeding to Ireland. In June the regiment reached Portpatrick,
and crossed immediately to Donaghadee, from whence it marched,
under the command of Colonel Dalrymple, to Newry, and in a few days
afterwards was removed to Dundalk.

In July the regiment received six hundred volunteers from the
Scotch Fencible corps serving in Ireland, and remained at Dundalk
until the close of the year, when a route for Dublin was received.
At this period, Colonel Dalrymple was appointed brigadier-general,
and the command of the regiment devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
John French.

On the 6th of December Major Denis Pack was promoted from the
fourth Royal Irish dragoon guards to be Lieutenant-Colonel in
the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel the
Honorable John Lindsay, who retired from the service.

[Sidenote: 1801.]

The regiment, early in the year 1801, marched from Dundalk to
Dublin, and occupied the barracks in the Palatine Square. On the
24th of April, Lieut.-Colonel Pack joined, and assumed the command
of the regiment.

[Sidenote: 1802.]

In March 1802, in which month the Peace of Amiens was concluded,
the regiment proceeded from Dublin, and was cantoned in the
county of Wicklow. The corps was so divided, that at Arklow, the
head-quarters, there were only two companies. In this situation it
continued for the remainder of the year.

[Sidenote: 1803.]

The regiment proceeded, in March 1803, in three divisions, to
Ballinasloe, where it remained for a few days, and afterwards
marched to Loughrea.

Major-General Sir John Francis Cradock, K.B., was appointed colonel
of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment on the 6th of August 1803, in
succession to General the Honorable William Gordon, who was removed
to the twenty-first Royal North British Fusiliers.

The regiment continued at Loughrea, but the light company was
detached to Limerick, to join a light battalion which was being
formed at that place.

[Sidenote: 1804.]

In May the regiment proceeded from Loughrea to the county of
Limerick, the head-quarters being stationed at Rathkeale; one
detachment at Newcastle, another at Tarbert, and a third at
Askeaton.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, war had recommenced
with France, and Bonaparte having made preparations for invading
Great Britain, additional measures of defence to those of the
former year were adopted by the Government;[18] and under the
“_Additional Force Act_,” passed on the 10th of July 1804, a
second battalion was added to the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, which
was to consist of men to be raised for limited service in certain
counties of North Britain. The second battalion was formed at
Dumbarton in October, to the command of which Lieut.-Colonel Lord
George Beresford was appointed. Its establishment was fixed at 23
serjeants, 22 drummers, 20 corporals, and 380 privates.

[Sidenote: 1805.]

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

In March 1805 the first battalion, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Pack, proceeded to Bandon in the county of Cork,
and was stationed at that place until July, when it marched to
Cork, and immediately afterwards to Monkstown, where it embarked
in transports, having been selected to form part of a secret
expedition under its former commander, Major-General Sir David
Baird.

In the beginning of August the embarkation was completed, and on
the 5th of that month the fleet sailed, convoyed by three 64-gun
ships, two frigates and gun-brigs, under the orders of Commodore
Sir Home Popham; and on the 28th of September the fleet, after a
very boisterous passage, arrived at Madeira.

On the 3d of October the fleet left Madeira, and on the 12th
of November arrived at St. Salvador, in the Brazils, where an
opportunity was afforded of refreshing the men, landing the sick,
and procuring some horses for the cavalry.

The fleet again put to sea on the 28th of November, and directed
its course towards the Dutch colony of the _Cape of Good Hope_,
then in possession of the Batavian Government, which was united
with France in hostility to Great Britain.

[Sidenote: 1806.]

The fleet arrived at the high table-land of the Cape of Good
Hope on the 4th of January 1806, and shortly afterwards came to
anchor. The whole of the following day the surf upon the shore
of the bay was too violent to admit of any attempt to land.
Brigadier-General William Carr, afterwards General Viscount,
Beresford, was detached, with such of the cavalry as had horses,
and the thirty-eighth regiment, to Saldanha Bay.[19]

In the morning of the 6th of January a landing was effected by
the Highland brigade, under the command of Brigadier-General
Ronald Craufurd Ferguson, in the performance of which service
Lieut.-Colonel Pack, the commanding officer of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment, was wounded. The following day was devoted to landing the
supplies and the remainder of the army.

Early in the morning of the 8th of January Major-General Sir David
Baird formed his troops in two columns, and moved up to the heights
of _Bleuberg_ (Blue Mountain), from whence the enemy was seen,
drawn up in order of battle, in two lines, with twenty-three pieces
of cannon, his numbers being calculated at 5,000, of which a large
proportion was cavalry.

The British lines were formed with promptitude and correctness, and
the enemy was attacked with the utmost spirit. He maintained his
ground with some firmness, until a charge of the Highland brigade
dislodged and completely routed him, with the loss of three guns
and 700 men.

In this affair the SEVENTY-FIRST had Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Robert
Campbell wounded. Five men were killed, and two serjeants and
sixty-four rank and file were wounded.

The troops halted for the night at the Reit Valley, and on the
9th of January the army moved towards the Salt River, where it
was intended to take up a position previously to the attack of
_Cape Town_, when a flag of truce appeared from the town, which
produced some negotiations, that terminated in its surrender to
His Majesty’s arms. Lieut.-General Janssens, the Governor of the
colony, after his defeat at Bleuberg on the 8th, had retired
towards the interior of the country by the Hottentot Holland
Kloof, or Pass, from whence, on the 19th of January, he signed and
ratified the treaty that placed the whole of the Cape of Good Hope
and its dependencies in the possession of Great Britain, under
whose sway it has since continued.

The Royal authority was subsequently granted for the SEVENTY-FIRST
to bear the words “CAPE OF GOOD HOPE” on the regimental colour and
appointments, to commemorate its distinguished gallantry at the
capture of that important colony.[20]

As the following letter from Brigadier General Ferguson to
Major-General Sir David Baird is very creditable to the regiment
and to its commander, it is here inserted.

  “_Cape Town, 19th January 1806._

  “SIR,

  “As in the affair of Bleuberg, on the 8th instant, chance placed
  two of the enemy’s guns in possession of the Highland brigade, I
  hope you will be pleased to order the allowance usually granted
  on such occasions to be issued, and shared amongst the 71st, 72d,
  and 93d regiments.

  “Although the guns fell into our hands in front of the 71st
  regiment, Lieut.-Colonel Pack (desirous that the three regiments
  should be considered as one family) has most handsomely withdrawn
  the prior claim His Majesty’s 71st regiment might have made,
  and to which the situation of the guns, when taken, would have
  entitled that most excellent corps.

  “I have, &c.
  “(Signed)      R. C. FERGUSON,
  “_Brigadier General_.

  “Major-General Sir David Baird.”

The SEVENTY-FIRST went into quarters at the cantonment of Wynberg,
about seven miles from Cape Town, on the road to Simon’s Bay,
where the battalion remained until the 12th of April, when, most
unexpectedly, an order arrived for its immediate embarkation on an
expedition to the Rio de la Plata in South America, which had been
planned by the British commanders, naval and military, at the Cape.
The SEVENTY-FIRST was the only corps of the Cape garrison destined
for this service, with the addition of a few dragoons and some
artillery. At this period the strength of the battalion amounted
to eight hundred rank and file, having received some recruits
from foreign corps at the Cape. The troops were to be commanded
by Brigadier-General William Carr Beresford, afterwards General
Viscount Beresford.

The battalion was embarked in line-of-battle ships and in
transports, and on the 14th of April the fleet sailed from Table
Bay, directing its course to the westward until the 20th, when,
in consequence of unfavourable weather, and having parted company
with one of the transports, in which were three companies of the
SEVENTY-FIRST, the signal was made to rendezvous at St. Helena,
at which island the fleet arrived on the 30th of April, with
the exception of the missing transport. Here the force under
Brigadier-General Beresford received an augmentation of two hundred
men from the St. Helena regiment, making a total of a thousand and
eighty-seven rank and file.

On the 2d of May the fleet sailed from St. Helena, and after a
tedious voyage arrived at Cape St. Mary’s, at the entrance of the
Rio de la Plata, on the 8th of June, where it met with the missing
transport.

The troops that had sailed in the line-of-battle ships were
transferred on the 16th of June to the transports, which proceeded
up the river, and on the 24th of that month came to anchor
opposite the city of _Buenos Ayres_. On the 25th, at night, the
SEVENTY-FIRST, with the other troops, effected a landing without
any opposition. The following morning they pushed forward, and met
the enemy at the village of Reduction, who made a trifling stand,
and then retired towards the city. On this occasion Captain Henry
Le Blanc of the SEVENTY-FIRST lost his leg, and a serjeant and five
rank and file were wounded.

The British troops continued to advance in pursuit of the enemy,
and on the morning of the 27th of June forced their passage across
the Chualo. Some skirmishing followed this movement, but the city
of _Buenos Ayres_ almost immediately surrendered. In the evening
the town and fort were taken possession of by the first battalion
of the SEVENTY-FIRST and detachments of Marines and St. Helena
Regiment.

The SEVENTY-FIRST occupied barracks in Buenos Ayres, and remained
undisturbed until the beginning of August, by which time the
enemy had collected a force of about 1,500 men, under a leader
named Pueridon, at five leagues from the city. Brigadier-General
Beresford, in consequence, moved out with three hundred of the
SEVENTY-FIRST, fifty from the St. Helena Regiment, and six field
pieces; attacked and dispersed the enemy, taking all his artillery,
namely, ten pieces of various calibre. The battalion had only five
men wounded in this operation.

About this period, a body of the enemy, headed by Colonel Liniers,
a French officer in the service of Spain, crossed from Colonna to
Concher, evidently with hostile intentions. Forming a junction with
the force under Pueridon, the whole marched upon Buenos Ayres.

On the 10th of August the enemy commenced operations, by the
massacre of a serjeant and his guard of the SEVENTY-FIRST Regiment,
who were posted at a place in the suburbs where the bull-fights
were usually exhibited. On the following day much skirmishing
ensued in the outskirts of the city, the enemy taking possession of
the tops of houses, from which he kept up a galling and destructive
fire.

During this time the main body of the British force took up a
position in the Grand Square, but afterwards retired into the fort
of Buenos Ayres. Being now bereft of all resources, and without
hopes of reinforcement, there appeared no alternative but to
capitulate, and about one o’clock on the 12th of August hostilities
ceased, and the fort was surrendered. The troops marched out with
the honors of war, and laid down their arms in the Square.

The SEVENTY-FIRST were now prisoners; the officers were allowed
their parole, and quartered upon the inhabitants; the men were
confined in the prisons of the city.

In these melancholy proceedings fell Lieutenant William Mitchell
and Ensign Thomas Lucas. Both had much distinguished themselves.
The battalion lost in killed and wounded ninety-one men.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

In August 1806 the second battalion embarked at Glasgow for
Ireland, and arrived at Belfast on the 1st of September.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

About the middle of September, the SEVENTY-FIRST were removed from
Buenos Ayres into the interior. Brigadier-General Beresford, with
his staff, and Lieut.-Colonel Pack, were placed at Luxon, from
whence they subsequently effected their escape, upon learning that
the removal of the prisoners still further up the country had been
ordered.

[Sidenote: 1807.]

Lieut.-Colonel Pack was thus enabled to join the troops which had
landed near Monte Video in January 1807, under the command of
Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty, and to afford assistance
in the important operations then being carried on. Sir Samuel
Auchmuty, at Lieut.-Colonel Pack’s request, directed a board of
naval and military officers to inquire into the particulars of his
escape, by whom it was unanimously approved, and he was declared
free to serve.[21]

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

The second battalion was removed from Ireland to Scotland in
January 1807, but returned to Ireland in June following.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

In May 1807, a further removal to the interior of the prisoners
took place. The officers were collected at a college belonging to
the Jesuits, about forty leagues to the northward of Cordova, and
entirely separated from their men. In this situation they remained
until August following, when, just as they were ordered to prepare
for a transfer to a station still more remote, the accounts of
the convention entered into by Lieut.-General John Whitelocke
were received, by which it was stipulated that the prisoners
should be restored to liberty, on condition that all the British
forces should be withdrawn. It is scarcely necessary to remark,
that the prospect of being restored to liberty and friends was
greatly damped by the military events which produced it, and which
completely extinguished the ardent hopes of success that had been
entertained from the arrival of the last British force in South
America.

In September the whole of the officers and men were re-conducted
to Buenos Ayres, from whence they were conveyed in boats to Monte
Video, and there embarked in transports, with a view of returning
to Europe.

It is a circumstance highly creditable to the character of the
soldiers of the SEVENTY-FIRST, that although so many and powerful
allurements were held out to induce them to remain in South
America, still not more than thirty-six individuals were found to
swerve from their duty and allegiance to their king and country.

The fleet sailed immediately, and after a tedious and rough
voyage of three months the transports having the SEVENTY-FIRST on
board put into Cork Harbour in December, and on the 27th of that
month the whole were landed, without uniform, clothing, arms, or
accoutrements, and marched to Middleton, under the command of Major
Henry Tolley, Lieut.-Colonel Pack having previously returned to
England from South America.

[Sidenote: 1808.]

In March 1808, the regiment proceeded from Middleton to Cork, where
its equipment in every respect was completed.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

The second battalion embarked at Londonderry for Scotland on
the 9th of April 1808, after transferring 200 men to the first
battalion, which raised the strength of the latter to nearly 900
rank and file.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

On the 26th of April, whilst in garrison at Cork, new colours,
to replace those left in South America, were presented to the
SEVENTY-FIRST by Lieut.-General John Floyd, who had commanded the
cavalry and advance in the campaign of 1790 in the East Indies.

The following animating and soldierlike address was made by the
gallant general on the occasion:

  “SEVENTY-FIRST!!

  “I am directed to perform the honorable duty of presenting your
  colours.

  “Brave SEVENTY-FIRST, the world is well acquainted with your
  gallant conduct at the capture of _Buenos Ayres_, in South
  America, under one of His Majesty’s bravest generals.

  “It is well known that you defended your conquest with the utmost
  courage, good conduct, and discipline to the last extremity. When
  diminished to a handful, hopeless of succour, and destitute of
  provisions, you were overwhelmed by multitudes, and reduced by
  the fortune of war to lose your liberty, and your well-defended
  colours, but not your honor. Your honor, SEVENTY-FIRST regiment,
  remains unsullied. Your last act in the field covered you with
  glory. Your generous despair, calling upon your general to suffer
  you to die with arms in your hands, proceeded from the genuine
  spirit of British soldiers. Your behavior in prosperity,--your
  sufferings in captivity,--and your faithful discharge of your
  duty to your King and country, are appreciated by all.

  “You who now stand on this parade, in defiance of the allurements
  held out to base desertion, are endeared to the army and to the
  country, and your conduct will ensure you the esteem of all true
  soldiers,--of all worthy men,--and fill every one of you with
  honest martial pride.

  “It has been my good fortune to have witnessed, in a remote
  part of the world, the early glories and gallant conduct of
  the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment in the field; and it is with great
  satisfaction I meet you again, with replenished ranks, with good
  arms in your hands, and with stout hearts in your bosoms.

  “Look forward, officers and soldiers, to the achievement of new
  honors and the acquirement of fresh fame!!

  “Officers! be the friends and guardians of these brave fellows
  committed to your charge!!

  “Soldiers! give your confidence to your officers. They have
  shared with you the chances of war; they have bravely bled along
  with you;--they will always do honor to themselves and you.
  Preserve your regiment’s reputation for valour in the field and
  regularity in quarters.

  “I have now the honor to present the

  “ROYAL COLOUR.
  “This is the KING’S COLOUR!!

  “I have now the honor to present your REGIMENTAL COLOUR.

  “This is the colour of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment.

  “May victory for ever crown these colours!!!”

The Peninsula was at this period the centre of political interest.
Portugal, deserted by her government, and Spain betrayed, the
people of each rose in arms to recover the national independence.
Dissensions had arisen in the royal family of Spain, occasioned by
the sway of Emanuel Godoy, who bore the title of Prince of Peace.
This minister was dismissed, but the court was unable to restore
tranquillity. In this emergency, the French emperor was solicited
to be umpire, and Napoleon ultimately placed the crown of Spain on
his brother Joseph, who was transferred from the throne of Naples.
The Spaniards flew to arms in consequence. The British government
resolved to aid the Spanish and Portuguese patriots, and a British
army was ordered to proceed to the Peninsula, under the command of
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. The first battalion of the
SEVENTY-FIRST regiment formed part of the force selected on this
occasion.

The first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment embarked at the
Cove of Cork on the 17th of June 1808. Its strength consisted of
fifty-two serjeants, twenty-two drummers, and eight hundred and
seventy-four rank and file.

In June 1808 His Majesty King George III. was pleased to approve
of the SEVENTY-FIRST bearing the title of _Glasgow_ regiment, in
addition to the appellation of _Highland_ regiment.

In the first instance, the SEVENTY-FIRST were brigaded with the
fifth, thirty-eighth, and fifth battalion of the sixtieth regiment,
under Brigadier-General Henry Fane, and sailed for Portugal, in
conjunction with the forces destined to aid the Spaniards and
Portuguese, on the 12th of July. After a favourable passage, the
troops anchored in Mondego Bay in the beginning of August, and a
landing was effected in the vicinity of the village of Frejus.

Early in the morning of the 4th of August a small piquet of the
enemy stationed in the neighbourhood fell back, and the operation
of disembarking the troops was carried into effect without
opposition. The army then moved on to a position across a deep
sandy country, where it halted, and encamped for the night.

At this period a change took place in the arrangement of the
brigades, and the first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST was placed,
with the thirty-sixth and fortieth regiments, in that commanded by
Major-General Ronald Craufurd Ferguson.

The division under Major-General Sir Brent Spencer, K.B., from
Cadiz, consisting of about four thousand men, joined on the 8th of
August; and, after a short halt, the army was again put in motion
to occupy a more forward position, where it remained for some days.
On the 17th of August the enemy, commanded by General Laborde, was
encountered near _Roleia_. The position was attacked, and carried
with great loss to the French, who retreated on Torres Vedras.

The light company of the SEVENTY-FIRST was the only part of the
regiment engaged, the remainder being employed in manœuvring on the
right flank of the French. The light company suffered a trifling
loss, having but one man killed and a few wounded.

The SEVENTY-FIRST subsequently received the royal authority to bear
the word “ROLEIA” on the regimental colour and appointments, in
commemoration of this victory.

Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, after the battle of Roleia,
did not pursue the enemy by the high roads, but keeping to the
right near the sea, marched to _Vimiera_, to cover the landing of a
brigade commanded by Major-General Anstruther, which was effected
on the 20th of August.

The morning of the 21st of August was given up to the troops,
in order to prepare and repose themselves. The men were engaged
in washing and cleaning their equipments, when the approach of
the enemy, moving to the left, was discovered at eight o’clock
in the morning, and the brigades commanded by Major-General
Ferguson, Brigadier-Generals Nightingall, Acland, and Bowes, were
consequently moved across a valley from the heights on the west to
those on the east of Vimiera.

Marshal Junot, Duke of Abrantes, moved on his army to the attack
of the position, and commenced it on the British centre, where the
fiftieth regiment was posted, moving along the front gradually to
the left, until the whole line became engaged.

A short time previously to this, the soldiers of the brigade were
ordered to sit down, with their arms in their hands, keeping
their formation. The enemy in the meantime cannonaded the whole
line, and pushed on his sharpshooters and infantry. To oppose
the former, Major-General Ferguson ordered the left sections of
companies to move forward and skirmish. Upon the retreat of the
enemy’s sharpshooters, the action became general along the front of
this brigade, and the whole moved forward to the attack. Nothing
could surpass the steadiness of the troops on this occasion, and
the general and commanding officer set a noble example, which was
followed by all.

The grenadier company of the SEVENTY-FIRST greatly distinguished
itself, in conjunction with a subdivision of the light company
of the thirty-sixth regiment. Captain Alexander Forbes, who
commanded the grenadier company, was ordered to the support of
some British artillery, and, seizing a favorable opportunity, made
a dash at a battery of the enemy’s artillery immediately in his
front. He succeeded in capturing five guns and a howitzer, with
horses, caissons, and equipment complete. In this affair alone the
grenadier company had Lieutenants John Pratt and Ralph Dudgeon and
thirteen rank and file wounded, together with two men killed.[22]

The French made a daring effort to retake their artillery, both
with cavalry and infantry; but the gallant conduct of the grenadier
company, and the advance of Major-General Ferguson’s brigade,
finally left the guns in the possession of those who had so
gallantly captured them.

George Clark, one of the pipers of the regiment, and afterwards
piper to the Highland Society of London, was wounded in
this action, and being unable to accompany his corps in the
advance against the enemy, put his pipes in order, and struck
up a favourite regimental air, to the great delight of his
comrades. This is the second instance in which the pipers of the
SEVENTY-FIRST have behaved with particular gallantry, and evinced
high feeling for the credit and honor of the corps.[23]

During the advance of the battalion, several prisoners were taken,
among whom was the French general, Brennier. Corporal John M^cKay,
of the SEVENTY-FIRST, who took him, was afterwards promoted to an
ensigncy in the Fourth West India Regiment.

The result of this battle was the total defeat of the enemy, who
subsequently retreated on Lisbon, with the loss of twenty-one
pieces of cannon, twenty-three ammunition waggons, with powder,
shells, stores of all descriptions, and 20,000 rounds of musket
ammunition, together with a great many officers and soldiers
killed, wounded, and taken prisoners.

The conduct of the battalion, and of its commanding officer,
Lieut.-Colonel Pack, was noticed in the public despatches, and the
thanks of both Houses of Parliament were conferred on the troops.

The following officers of the SEVENTY-FIRST were wounded in the
battle of _Vimiera_: Captains Arthur Jones and Maxwell Mackenzie;
Lieutenants John Pratt, William Hartley, Augustus M^cIntyre, and
Ralph Dudgeon; Ensign James Campbell, and Acting Adjutant R.
M^cAlpin.

The SEVENTY-FIRST subsequently received the royal authority to bear
the word “_Vimiera_” on the regimental colour and appointments, in
commemoration of this battle.

The “_Convention of Cintra_” was the result of this victory, and
it was signed on the 30th of August. By its provisions the French
army evacuated Portugal, which country became freed from its
oppressors.

The British army was ordered to move forward to Lisbon, some of the
reinforcements for it having preceded it by water, and occupied the
forts at the mouth of the Tagus. The French army having by this
convention fallen back on Lisbon, the British proceeded to the
vicinity of Fort St. Julien, and encamped.

All the objects of the expedition being carried into effect,
and the French troops embarked for France, the British army
remained for some time at Lisbon and its vicinity. At this period
(September) Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, having assumed the
command, made dispositions for entering Spain.

The first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST was now brigaded with the
thirty-sixth and ninety-second regiments under Brigadier-General
Catlin Craufurd, and placed in the division under the command of
Lieut.-General the Honorable John Hope, afterwards the Earl of
Hopetoun. On the 27th of October the division was put in motion,
and after a short stay at Badajoz resumed the march, proceeding
by Merida, Truxillo, Jaraicejo, Puerto-de-Merivette, and crossing
the Tagus at the bridge of Almaraz, directed its route upon
Talavera-de-la-Reyna. From this town the column proceeded to the
Escurial, seven leagues to the north-west of Madrid.

Intelligence was here received of the enemy’s approach towards
Madrid, and two companies of the SEVENTY-FIRST, under Major
Archibald Campbell, were pushed forward to occupy the important
pass in the Guadarama Mountains, which separate Old from New
Castile. After a halt of a few days, the division was put in
motion over the Guadarama Pass to Villa Castin, at which place
Lieut.-General the Honorable John Hope, in consequence of the
intelligence which he received of the enemy’s movements, made
a night march to the left, by Avila and Peneranda, and finally
proceeded to Alba-de-Tormes. At the latter place a junction was
formed with a detachment from the army under Lieut.-General Sir
John Moore, then at Salamanca. The army under Sir John Moore
was shortly afterwards put in motion towards Valladolid, and
subsequently to the left, to form a junction with Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird’s division, which had landed at Corunna.

Previously to this period, the Spanish armies under General
Blake, near Bilboa on the left, General Castanos in the centre,
and General Palafox lower down the Ebro on the right, had been
completely defeated; and Lieut.-General Sir John Moore consequently
made arrangements for a retreat on Portugal by Ciudad Rodrigo; but
it having been represented to him that Madrid held out against the
French, he was induced to effect a junction with Lieut.-General Sir
David Baird, in order to make a diversion in favour of Madrid, by
attacking Marshal Soult on the river Carion.

The British force, twenty-nine thousand strong, joined at Toro on
the 21st of December, and on the 23d of that month Sir John Moore
advanced with the whole army. The cavalry had already met with that
of the enemy, and the infantry were within two hours’ march of him,
when an intercepted letter informed the British commander that
Napoleon, who had entered Madrid on the 4th of December, was then
in full march for Salamanca and Benevente. A retreat on Corunna,
through Gallicia, was immediately decided on, that through Portugal
being then impracticable.

Accordingly the several divisions marched towards the Esla,
the greater part crossing by the bridge of Benevente on the
26th of December, when, after a day’s halt, the cavalry under
Lieut.-General Lord Paget and Brigadier-General the Honorable
Charles Stewart had an engagement with some of the Imperial Guards
that had forded the river Esla under General Le Fevre, who was made
prisoner, with several of his men.

At this period the situation of the British army was dispiriting
in the extreme. In the midst of winter, in a dreary and desolate
country, the soldiers, chilled and drenched with the heavy rains,
and wearied by long and rapid marches, were almost destitute of
fuel to cook their victuals, and it was with extreme difficulty
that they could procure shelter. Provisions were scarce,
irregularly issued, and difficult of attainment. The waggons,
in which were their magazines, baggage, and stores, were often
deserted in the night by the Spanish drivers, who were terrified
by the approach of the French. Thus baggage, ammunition, stores,
and even money were destroyed to prevent them falling into the
hands of the enemy; and the weak, the sick, and the wounded were
necessarily left behind. The SEVENTY-FIRST suffered in proportion
with the rest, and by weakness, sickness, and fatigue lost about
ninety-three men.

[Sidenote: 1809.]

On the 5th of January 1809, a position was taken up at Lugo,
where some skirmishing occurred, in which three companies of the
SEVENTY-FIRST were engaged, and repulsed the enemy.

Lieut.-General Francis Dundas was appointed from the ninety-fourth
regiment to be Colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST on the 7th of January
1809, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir John Francis Cradock,
K.B., removed to the forty-third regiment.

The retreat was again commenced on the 9th of January; and on
the 11th the army, still nearly fifteen thousand strong, reached
_Corunna_. The British army, having accomplished one of the most
celebrated retreats recorded in modern history, repulsing the
pursuing enemy in all his attacks, and having traversed two hundred
and fifty miles of mountainous country under very disheartening
circumstances, accompanied by severe privation, was not destined to
embark for England without a battle.

The transports not having arrived, a position was occupied in
advance of _Corunna_, and some sharp skirmishing ensued, in which
four companies of the SEVENTY-FIRST were warmly engaged, and lost
several men in killed and wounded. Lieutenant William Lockwood
was severely wounded. On this ground the battle of _Corunna_ was
fought, on the 16th of January; but the SEVENTY-FIRST, being placed
on the extreme left of the British line, had little to do therein.
The result of the action was glorious to the British army, but was
darkened by the loss of Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, who received
a severe wound during the battle, and died at ten o’clock on the
same night. His remains were wrapped in a military cloak, and
interred in the Citadel of Corunna, over which Marshal Soult, with
the true feeling of a soldier, erected a monument.

Lieut.-General Sir David Baird, who succeeded to the command upon
Sir John Moore being wounded, was also wounded, and the command
devolved upon Lieut.-General the Honorable John Hope.

At eight o’clock on the night of the 16th of January the troops
quitted their position, leaving the piquets posted, and a few men
to keep up the fires, and then marched into Corunna, where they
embarked for England on the following day.

In commemoration of this battle, and of the conduct of the
battalion during the expedition, the SEVENTY-FIRST, in common with
the army employed under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, received the
royal authority to bear the word “CORUNNA” on the regimental colour
and appointments.[24]

The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were conferred on
the troops, and were communicated to Lieut.-Colonel Pack by
Lieut.-General Sir David Baird in the following letter:--

  “_Portsmouth, 30th January 1809._

  “SIR,

  “I have great pleasure in transmitting to you copies of letters
  from the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons,
  enclosing the Resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, dated
  25th of January 1809, which contain the thanks of those Houses to
  the army lately engaged before Corunna.

  “In communicating to you, Sir, this most signal mark of the
  approbation of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great
  Britain and Ireland, allow me to add my warmest congratulations
  upon a distinction which you, and the corps under your command on
  that day, had a share in obtaining for His Majesty’s service.

  “I have, &c.
  “(Signed)      DAVID BAIRD,
  “_Lieut.-General_.

  “_Officer commanding First Battalion_
  “SEVENTY-FIRST regiment.”

After the battalion had landed at Ramsgate, it was marched to
Ashford in Kent, where it continued for some time, collecting the
men, who from contrary winds were driven into different ports.

While at Ashford the battalion was brigaded with the Warwick
militia and the ninety-first regiment, under Brigadier-General the
Baron de Rottenburg. Great sickness prevailed at this station, and
Surgeon James Evans and several of the soldiers died of typhus
fever.

On the 20th of March 1809 the Royal authority was granted for the
SEVENTY-FIRST to be formed into a _light infantry_ regiment, when
it was directed that the clothing, arming, and discipline should
be the same in all respects as the forty-third, fifty-second,
sixty-eighth, and eighty-fifth regiments.

The first battalion marched, on the 27th of April 1809, for
Brabourne-Lees barracks, and was brigaded with the sixty-eighth and
eighty-fifth light infantry regiments. Every exertion was here made
to increase the strength and improve the discipline of the corps.
In June the first battalion was increased by a large reinforcement,
consisting of several officers and 311 non-commissioned officers
and privates from the second battalion, which continued to be
stationed in North Britain. Several volunteers from the militia
were also received at this period.

Immense preparations had been made by the British Government to fit
out the most formidable armament that had for a long time proceeded
from England. The troops amounted to 40,000 men, commanded by
Lieut.-General the Earl of Chatham; the naval portion consisted of
thirty-nine ships of the line, thirty-six frigates, and numerous
gun-boats and bomb-vessels, and other small craft, under Admiral
Sir Richard Strachan. The object of the expedition was to obtain
possession of the islands at the mouth of the _Scheldt_, and to
destroy the French ships in that river, with the docks and arsenals
at Antwerp. The first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST, towards the
end of June, received orders to prepare for the above service, and
marched, on the 28th and 29th of that month, in two divisions,
encamping near Gosport.

On the 16th of July the battalion, consisting of three field
officers, six captains, twenty-seven subalterns, five staff,
forty-eight serjeants, and 974 drummers and rank and file,
embarked at Portsmouth on board His Majesty’s ships _Belleisle_
and _Impérieuse_, and towards the end of the month sailed for the
Downs.

The battalion was brigaded, under Brigadier-General the Baron de
Rottenburg, with the sixty-eighth and eighty-fifth light infantry,
in the division commanded by Lieut.-General Alexander Mackenzie
Fraser, and in the corps of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, K.B.

The expedition sailed from the Downs on the 28th of July, and
having arrived off the Roompet Channel, preparations were made for
landing; small craft to cover the landing were also sent in shore,
and the light brigade, composed of the sixty-eighth, SEVENTY-FIRST,
and eighty-fifth light infantry, were landed under their fire. In
an instant they were in contact with the enemy’s sharpshooters, who
fell back, skirmishing. Being pushed hard, four guns, with their
equipment, and several prisoners were taken by two companies of the
SEVENTY-FIRST, under Captains George Sutherland and Henry Hall, and
one company of the eighty-fifth regiment.

A battery and flagstaff on the coast were taken possession of by
the tenth company of the SEVENTY-FIRST, and in lieu of a flag a
soldier’s red jacket was hoisted on it.

This advance having succeeded at all points, and the enemy
having fallen back on _Flushing_ and _Middleburg_, the army was
disembarked. The advance then dividing, proceeded by different
routes. The SEVENTY-FIRST moved by the sea dyke on a fort
called _Ter Veer_, the situation and strength of which was not
sufficiently known, an enemy’s deserter having given but imperfect
intelligence respecting it.

After nightfall the column continued to advance in perfect silence,
with orders to attack the post with the bayonet, when, on a sudden,
the advance-guard fell in with an enemy’s party, who came out for
the purpose of firing some houses which overlooked the works. The
column following the advance-guard had entered an avenue or road
leading to the fort, when the advance commenced the action with the
enemy, who, retiring within the place, opened a tremendous fire
from his works with artillery and musketry. Some guns pointing down
the road by which the battalion advanced did great execution, and
the SEVENTY-FIRST had Surgeon Charles Henry Quin killed, and about
eighteen men killed and wounded. The column, after some firing,
retired, and the place was the next day regularly invested by sea
and land. It took three days to reduce it, when it capitulated,
with its stores, and a garrison of 800 men.

_Flushing_ having been invested on the 1st of August, the
SEVENTY-FIRST, after the surrender of Ter Veer, were ordered into
the line of circumvallation, and placed on the extreme left,
resting on the Scheldt. The preparations for the attack on the
town having been completed, on the 13th a dreadful fire was opened
from the batteries and bomb-vessels, and congreve rockets having
been thrown into the town, it was on fire in many places. The
ships having joined in the attack, the enemy’s fire gradually
slackened, and at length ceased. A summons being sent in, a delay
was demanded, but being rejected, the firing recommenced.

On the 14th of August one of the outworks was carried at the point
of the bayonet by a party of detachments and two companies of the
SEVENTY-FIRST under Lieut.-Colonel Pack.

In this affair, Ensign Donald Sinclair, of the SEVENTY-FIRST, was
killed; Captain George Spottiswoode and a few men were wounded.

_Flushing_, with its garrison of 6,000 men, capitulated on the 15th
of August, and the right gate was occupied by a detachment of 300
men of the first or Royal Scots, and the left gate by a detachment
of similar strength of the SEVENTY-FIRST under Major Arthur Jones.
The naval arsenal, and some vessels of war which were on the
stocks, fell into the hands of the British.

The SEVENTY-FIRST shortly after proceeded to Middleburg, where the
battalion remained for a few days, when it was ordered to occupy
_Ter Veer_, of which place Lieut.-Colonel Pack was appointed
commandant, and Lieutenant Henry Clements, of the SEVENTY-FIRST,
town major. The battalion remained doing duty in the garrison until
this island, after destroying the works, &c., was finally evacuated
on the 22d of December.

On the 23d of December the battalion embarked in transports, and
sailed for England, after a service of five months in a very
unhealthy climate, which cost the battalion the loss of the
following officers and men.

                                           Serjeants, Drummers,
                             Officers.      and Rank and File.
  Died on service               1                  57
  Killed                        2                  19
  Died after return home        2                   9
                               --                  --
                   Total        5                  85

In passing Cadsand, that fort opened a fire on the transports, one
of which, having part of the SEVENTY-FIRST on board, was struck by
a round shot, which carried off Serjeant Steel’s legs above the
knees.

On the 25th of December the first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST
disembarked at Deal, and marched to Brabourne-Lees barracks,
in Kent, where it was again brigaded with the sixty-eighth and
eighty-fifth light infantry, and was occupied in putting itself in
an efficient state for active service.

[Sidenote: 1810.]

Upon the SEVENTY-FIRST being made light infantry, they were
permitted to retain such parts of the national dress as might
not be inconsistent with their duties as a light corps. A
correspondence on the subject took place between Lieut.-Colonel
Pack and the Adjutant-General in April 1810, and the following
reply was received from head-quarters.

  “_Horse Guards, 12th April 1810._

  “SIR,

  “Having submitted to the Commander-in-Chief your letter of the
  4th instant, I am directed to state, that there is no objection
  to the SEVENTY-FIRST being denominated _Highland Light Infantry
  Regiment_, or to their retaining their pipes, and the Highland
  garb for the pipers; and that they will, of course, be permitted
  to wear caps according to the pattern which was lately approved
  and sealed by authority.[25]

  “I have, &c.
  “(Signed)      WILLIAM WYNYARD,
  “_Deputy Adjutant-General_.

  “_Lieut.-Colonel Pack,_
  “_71st Regiment._”

On the 8th of May 1810 the first battalion marched to Deal
barracks, where every exertion was continued to render it fit for
active service. Here the battalion was deprived of the services
of Lieut.-Colonel Pack, who was appointed a brigadier in the
Portuguese army under Marshal William Carr Beresford, afterwards
General the Viscount Beresford.

Nothing of moment occurred until the early part of September, when
the battalion received orders to hold six companies in readiness
for foreign service. They were prepared accordingly by drafting
into them, from the companies which were to remain at home, the
most effective officers and men, several not having recovered from
the Walcheren fever.

The following were the companies selected and completed for foreign
service, namely:--

   1st, or Capt. M^cIntyre’s,
   2d,  or   “   Hall’s,
   3d,  or   “   Adamson’s,
   4th, or   “   Walker’s,
   6th, or   “   Spottiswoode’s,
  10th, or   “   Lewis Grant’s.

They consisted of two field officers, six captains, fifteen
lieutenants, seven ensigns, four staff, thirty-eight serjeants,
twelve drummers, and six hundred and three rank and file.

On the 14th of September the above companies embarked in the Downs
on board the Melpomene and St. Fiorenzo frigates; three companies,
with the staff, and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Nathaniel Levett
Peacocke, on board the former; the remaining three companies, under
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Reynell, afterwards colonel of the
regiment, on board the latter. They sailed on the following day for
Lisbon, and entered the Tagus on the 25th of September, after a
short and pleasant passage. The companies were disembarked on the
following day, and quartered in the San Benito and Espirito Santo
convents.

The greatest exertions were made to complete the companies in field
equipment, bât-mules, &c., which being effected, the detachment
marched from Lisbon on the 2d of October to Mafra, where it was
shortly afterwards joined by Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry
Cadogan, who assumed the command, and Lieut.-Colonel Peacocke
returned to the second battalion in North Britain.

The detachment being ordered to join the army under Lieut.-General
Viscount Wellington, then retreating before Marshal Massena, Prince
of Essling, marched from Mafra on the 8th of October, and on the
10th of that month effected the junction at Sobral, where it was
brigaded with the fiftieth and ninety-second regiments under
Major-General Sir William Erskine, in the first division under
Lieut.-General Sir Brent Spencer, K.B.

The army having retired into a position in the rear of Sobral,
that place was occupied by the SEVENTY-FIRST, having for its
support the fiftieth and ninety-second regiments and Major-General
Alan Cameron’s brigade. On the 12th of October the piquets were
violently attacked by the enemy’s advance, and retired skirmishing.
In the meantime the place was ordered to be evacuated, and the
piquets having joined, the SEVENTY-FIRST took up a position on
the outside, within musket-shot of the town. In this affair the
detachment had eight men killed, and thirty-four wounded.

In this position the SEVENTY-FIRST continued, when on the 14th of
October they were again attacked with the greatest impetuosity,
and charged with the bayonet. The enemy was completely repulsed,
with very considerable loss in killed and wounded, being chased to
the spot from which he made the attack. Both parties resumed their
original position.

In Viscount Wellington’s despatch reporting this affair, the names
of Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry Cadogan, commanding the
SEVENTY-FIRST, and that of Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Reynell,
were particularly mentioned.

A soldier of the sixth company, named John Rea, behaved on this
occasion in the most gallant manner, and particularly distinguished
himself, for which he received a silver medal, with the following
inscription: “To John Rea, for his exemplary courage and good
conduct as a soldier at Sobral, 14th October 1810.”

On the 15th of October the SEVENTY-FIRST were ordered to withdraw
into the position at Zibriera, which was a continuation of the
lines of Torres Vedras. In this celebrated position, which bid
defiance to the French army, the troops were constantly on the
alert, and occupied in rendering it as strong as circumstances
would admit, and in observing the motions of the enemy.

Marshal Massena did not think proper to attack the British army
in this stronghold, and occupied his time in reconnoissances and
demonstrations, until compelled, through want of provisions, and
consequent sickness of his troops, to abandon his designs, and
retire to a position in his rear. This object he finally effected
in a masterly manner in the night between the 14th and 15th of
November, followed by the allied forces. Both armies thus evacuated
positions on which the attention of Europe had been fixed, and
which they had occupied for a month in the presence of each other.

The division in which the six companies of the SEVENTY-FIRST were
placed advanced by the route of Alemquer, Cartaxo, Atelaya, and
Almoster, and halted in and about the latter place from the 20th
to the 26th of November inclusive. The enemy in the meantime
retired to an extremely strong position at and in the vicinity
of Santarem, where Marshal Massena halted, although threatened
by Viscount Wellington, who, after some manœuvring, took up a
position immediately in the enemy’s front, having his head-quarters
at Cartaxo, and the different corps of the army cantoned in the
villages. The brigade to which the SEVENTY-FIRST belonged occupied
Alquintrinha.

[Sidenote: 1811.]

At this place the SEVENTY-FIRST remained in quarters until March
1811, at which period the army, having been reinforced[26], was
about to resume the offensive, when the enemy retired during
the night of the 5th of March, taking the same road, through
Estremadura, by which he entered Portugal.

The British army accordingly advanced in pursuit of Marshal
Massena, and the brigade in which was the SEVENTY-FIRST accompanied
it, moving by Redinha, Miranda de Corvo, and Saryedes, passing the
Coa, a little above Sabugal, upon the 5th of April, and on the 9th
arrived at Albergaria, a small town on the frontiers of Spain. The
SEVENTY-FIRST remained in Albergaria until the 2d of May, when the
enemy, having been strongly reinforced, moved from Salamanca, and
on that day crossed the frontier with a large convoy of provisions
for Almeida, then closely invested by the Portuguese forces under
Brigadier-General Pack.

In consequence of this movement, the allied army broke up its
cantonments on the Azava, and formed in order of battle upon the
high ground behind the Duas Casas, the left extending to the
high road to Almeida which crossed the river by a ford near Fort
Conception, and the right keeping up a communication with the
bridge at Sabugal; opposite the centre, the village of _Fuentes
d’Onor_ was strongly occupied by light infantry.

Upon the 3d of May the French took post on the opposite side of the
valley of the Duas Casas, their left fronting Fuentes d’Onor, and
their right extending about two miles and a half to Alameda. In the
afternoon of the 3d of May they attacked Fuentes d’Onor with much
vigour. That post was defended with the greatest bravery until the
light companies, being worn out and harassed by repeated attacks,
were obliged to retire, and the enemy possessed himself of the
lower part of the village.

The SEVENTY-FIRST were now ordered up to support, and, commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry Cadogan, charged the enemy
through the village and across the Duas Casas, taking ten officers
and about a hundred men prisoners. The corps retained its conquest
that night and the whole of the next day, but upon Sunday the 5th
of May, the French having succeeded in turning some troops to the
immediate right, were obliged to give way; having been immediately
supported by the seventy-fourth and eighty-eighth regiments, they
again advanced, took possession of and retained the village until
the conclusion of the action.

A struggle of such duration could not be carried on without great
loss, and the SEVENTY-FIRST suffered severely. They went into
action about 320 strong, and lost nearly one half of their number
in killed and wounded.

The SEVENTY-FIRST had Lieutenants John Consell, William Houston,
and John Graham, and Ensign Donald John Kearns, together with four
serjeants and twenty-two rank and file, killed.

Captains Peter Adamson and James M^cIntyre, Lieutenants William
M^cCraw, Humphrey Fox, and Robert Law (Adjutant), Ensigns Charles
Cox, John Vandeleur, and Carique Lewin, six serjeants, three
buglers, and one hundred rank and file, were wounded. Two officers,
with several men, were taken prisoners.

In commemoration of the gallantry displayed in this prolonged
action, the SEVENTY-FIRST subsequently received the Royal authority
to bear the words “FUENTES D’ONOR” on the regimental colour and
appointments.

Viscount Wellington particularly mentioned the name of
Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry Cadogan in his despatch, and
being highly gratified with the conduct of the SEVENTY-FIRST
on this occasion, directed that a non-commissioned officer
should be selected for a commission. According to his Lordship’s
recommendation, Quartermaster-Serjeant William Gavin was shortly
afterwards promoted to an ensigncy in the regiment.

The SEVENTY-FIRST, upon the 14th, returned to their old quarters
at Albergaria, and remained there until the 26th of May, when the
brigade was ordered to the Alemtejo frontier, as a reinforcement to
Marshal Sir William Beresford’s[27] army, at this time besieging
Badajoz, and threatened by the advance of Marshal Soult from the
south of Spain.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

On the 15th of May 1811, the second battalion embarked at Leith for
South Britain, arrived at Ramsgate on the 23d of that month, and
remained stationed in England for nearly two years.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

The first battalion, upon its route southward, crossed the Tagus
on the 31st of May, and arrived near Albuhera on the 14th of June,
having passed through Portalegre, Aronches, Campo Mayor, and
Talavera Real.

The sanguinary battle of Albuhera, fought on the 16th of May,
had obliged Marshal Soult to retire previously to the arrival of
the reinforcement, which being considered no longer necessary,
the battalion retired to Elvas, where it remained two days; the
battalion again moved to Toro de Moro on the 19th of June, where it
remained for a month. At this encampment a detachment of 350 men,
with a proportion of officers, joined from the second battalion
then stationed at Deal.

About this period the first battalion became a part of the army
under Lieut.-General Rowland (afterwards Viscount) Hill. The
junction of the armies of Marshals Marmont and Soult having
obliged Viscount Wellington to raise the siege of Badajoz, which
had been resumed after the battle of Albuhera, the battalion, in
co-operation with his Lordship’s retrograde movement, retired
to Borba on the 20th of July. Here it remained until the 1st of
September, when it moved to Portalegre, and thence marched to
Castello de Vido on the 4th of October.

A detachment from Marshal Soult’s army under General Girard
having been collecting contributions in Spanish Estremadura,
Lieut.-General Rowland Hill, with a view of putting a stop to his
movements, broke up his cantonments at Portalegre upon the 22d of
October, proceeding by Albuquerque and Malpartida. On the 27th,
when within a moderate march of the enemy at _Arroyo-del-Molinos_,
Lieut.-General Hill halted his troops, and, at night, breaking up
his bivouac, made a flank movement close to the road by which the
French intended to march on the following morning. In that position
he awaited the approach of day, when, on the 28th of October, the
British marched directly on the rear of the town with such celerity
that the cavalry piquets were rushed upon before they had time
to mount. The French main body, though in the act of filing out,
had so little intimation of danger that the officers and men were
surrounded before their formation was effected, and to seek safety
they individually dispersed. Many of them were killed, and about
1,400 were taken prisoners. All the enemy’s artillery and baggage
were captured. General Brun and Colonel the Prince of Aremberg,
together with several other officers, were among the prisoners.

In this brilliant affair the SEVENTY-FIRST was one of the three
corps that advanced through the centre of the town, and were,
therefore, principally engaged; but the enemy, from his complete
surprise, being unable to make a combined resistance, the British
sustained but trifling loss.

The battalion subsequently returned to Portalegre, where it arrived
early in November.

Lieut.-General Hill, on the 7th of November, issued the following
General Order:--

  “_Portalegre, 7th November 1811._

  “Lieut.-General Hill has great satisfaction in congratulating the
  troops on the success which has attended their recent operations
  in Estremadura, and in so doing he cannot but endeavour to do
  justice to the merits of those through whose exertions it has
  been obtained. A patient willing endurance of forced and night
  marches, during the worst of weather and over bad roads, of
  bivouacs in wet weather, oftentimes without cover and without
  fire, and a strict observance of discipline, are qualities,
  however common in British soldiers, which the Lieut.-General
  cannot pass unnoticed. Having on this occasion witnessed the
  exertion of them in no ordinary degree, he feels that nothing
  but the most zealous attention of commanding officers, the
  goodwill and zealous spirit of the non-commissioned officers and
  soldiers, could produce such an effect, and he requests they
  will, generally and individually, accept his warmest thanks,
  particularly those corps which were engaged in the action of
  _Arroyo-del-Molinos_, whose silent attention to orders, when
  preparing to attack, and when manœuvring before the enemy, could
  not but excite his notice, and give them an additional claim on
  him.”

Letters from the Secretary of State, dated the 2d, and from His
Royal Highness the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief, dated the 6th
December, were promulgated, expressive of His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent’s approbation and thanks to Lieut.-General Hill, and
the troops under his command, for their brilliant operations on
the recent expedition in Spanish Estremadura, in having totally
surprised and defeated the enemy under General Girard.

Viscount Wellington having made preparations for the recapture
of _Ciudad Rodrigo_, concentrated the main body of the army in
that neighbourhood, and the troops under Lieut.-General Hill were
therefore ordered to divert the enemy’s attention in the south.

The first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST remained at Portalegre
until the 25th of December, when the brigade moved into Estremadura
for the purpose of expelling the French, who were ravaging the
country. After the performance of this duty, the battalion returned
to its former quarters at Portalegre in February 1812.

[Sidenote: 1812.]

Upon the 19th of March 1812, the battalion moved northward to
Castello Branco, where it remained for about a week, and afterwards
returned for the last time to Portalegre.

The Earl of Wellington having made arrangements for the third siege
of _Badajoz_, Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland Hill’s[28] corps was
destined to cover his movements, and with that view proceeded on
the 21st of March towards Merida, and afterwards to Don Benito,
where the troops remained for a few days; but upon the approach of
Marshal Soult with a large army, with the intention of raising the
siege, Lieut.-General Hill retired upon Albuhera, through Arroyo de
San Servan and Talavera Real.

Badajoz having been assaulted and carried by the troops under
the Earl of Wellington on the night of the 6th of April, after a
sanguinary conflict, the movement of Marshal Soult was rendered
nugatory, and the troops under his orders retired into Andalusia.

Marshal Marmont having, during the progress of the siege,
penetrated into the province of Beira, and threatened Ciudad
Rodrigo and Almeida, the Earl of Wellington, after the fall of
Badajoz, crossed the Tagus, leaving Sir Rowland Hill’s force to
watch Marshal Soult, which took post at Almendralejos for that
purpose.

The battalion was stationed at this town from the 13th of April
until the 11th of May. It having then become expedient to render
the communications between the French armies on the north and south
of the Tagus as precarious as possible, by the destruction of the
bridge of boats at _Almaraz_, the corps under Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill, being the most disposable and convenient force, was
accordingly ordered on this important service.

The French, feeling the importance of this bridge to their mutual
strength and security, had surrounded it on both sides of the river
with formidable enclosed works, having in the interior of them
casemated and loop-holed towers. The troops appointed for these
strong works, consequently, anticipated an arduous struggle.

Upon the 12th of May the corps broke up from Almendralejos, and
marching by Truxillo and Jaraicejo, reached on the 18th of that
month the sierra, five miles from Almaraz, on which stands the
Castle of Mirabete. This post was so strongly fortified that it
blocked up the only road to Almaraz for the passage of artillery,
which was considered by the enemy absolutely necessary for the
destruction of the works. Sir Rowland Hill thought otherwise;
and ascertaining that infantry could cross the sierra by a track
through Roman Gordo, he left his artillery, and descended at
night with a column of 2,000 men. The leading company arrived at
dawn of day close to the principal fort, built on a height a few
hundred yards in front of the _tête-de-pont_; but such were the
difficulties of the road that a considerable time elapsed before
the rear closed, during which the troops were fortunately sheltered
by a ravine, unseen by the enemy.

On the 19th of May the fiftieth regiment and the left wing of the
SEVENTY-FIRST, having been provided with ladders, were appointed to
escalade the works of _Fort Napoleon_, supported by the right wing
of the SEVENTY-FIRST, and the ninety-second regiment.

From a feint made upon Mirabete, the French were aware that an
enemy was in the neighbourhood. The garrison was on the alert;
immediately opened a heavy fire, and vigorously resisted the
efforts made to push up the scarp; but the moment the first men
gained a footing on the parapet the enemy took to flight. The
whole of this brilliant affair was completed in the short space of
fifteen minutes, and with little loss.

The SEVENTY-FIRST had Captain Lewis Grant, with one serjeant and
seven rank and file, killed; Lieutenants William Lockwood and
Donald Ross, three serjeants, and twenty-nine rank and file were
wounded.

The names of thirty-six non-commissioned officers and soldiers
of the SEVENTY-FIRST were inserted in regimental orders for
conspicuous bravery upon this occasion, and the Royal authority
was subsequently granted for the word “ALMARAZ” to be borne on the
regimental colour and appointments.[29]

The following orders were issued upon this occasion:--

  “_Bivouac, near Fort Napoleon_,
  “19th May 1812.

  “BRIGADE ORDER.

  “Major-General Howard cannot delay expressing his warmest
  acknowledgments to Lieut.-Colonel Stewart and Major Harrison,
  of the fiftieth regiment, and Major Cother of the SEVENTY-FIRST
  regiment, who commanded the three columns of attack this morning
  on Fort Napoleon and the works on the Tagus, for the gallant and
  distinguished manner in which they led the columns intrusted to
  them, as well as to all the other officers, non-commissioned
  officers and privates, for their bravery and good conduct, which
  produced the brilliant result of the capture of the works in
  question.”


  “_Truxillo, May 22nd, 1812._

  “GENERAL ORDER.

  “Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill congratulates the troops on
  the success which has attended their exertions in the present
  expedition. Every object for which it was undertaken has been
  attained, and in the manner most desirable and effectual. It
  is highly gratifying to the Lieut.-General to report on this
  occasion his admiration of the discipline and the valour of
  the troops under his command. The chance of war gave to the
  fiftieth and SEVENTY-FIRST regiments the most conspicuous share
  in these events, who nobly profited by the opportunity; but the
  Lieut.-General is satisfied that the same zeal and the same
  spirit would have been found in every corps if there had been
  occasion for bringing them into play.

  “The Lieut.-General has not failed to report to his Excellency
  the Commander of the Forces the particulars of this brilliant
  service, and the good conduct of all those concerned in it.
  He will therefore not say more at present than to express his
  warmest thanks for the assistance which he has received from
  all ranks; and he is confident, when it shall again be his good
  fortune to lead them against the enemy, he shall have to report
  conduct equally honorable to them, and equally advantageous to
  their country.”

The bridge and works in the neighbourhood of Almaraz having been
completely destroyed, the SEVENTY-FIRST returned to Truxillo, where
they remained a few days, then moved to Merida, and afterwards
to Almendralejos. Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s force having
received orders to make a diversion in the south, while the main
army was moving northward on _Salamanca_, the battalion again moved
from Almendralejos to the borders of Andalusia, through Llerena.
On this march the advanced parties of cavalry were constantly
skirmishing with the enemy, but the SEVENTY-FIRST were not engaged.

From Llerena the battalion returned to Zafra, where, after a short
halt, it proceeded to Villa Franca, and finally to Don Benito. In
these marches through Estremadura the weather was oppressively hot,
and, joined to the clouds of dust raised by the troops, was so
fatiguing that it was considered expedient at one time to move by
night, and thus these inconveniences were alleviated.

While the force under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill had been thus
employed, the allied army under the Earl of Wellington had gained
a victory on the 22d of July over the French at _Salamanca_, for
which he was advanced to the dignity of marquis.

From Don Benito the battalion moved upon the 13th of September, and
passing through Truxillo, Talavera, and Toledo, arrived at Aranjuez
upon the 1st of October, from which place, after a halt of three
weeks, it moved to Ponte Duenna, further up the Tagus.

The sudden approach of the united armies of Marshals Soult and
Suchet rendered a speedy retreat necessary, and the division
accordingly retired from Ponte Duenna in the night of the 28th of
October, moving to form a junction with the army of the Marquis
of Wellington, who had now relinquished the siege of Burgos. Near
Madrid the division halted for a short period, when, being joined
by the garrison of that city, the troops retired leisurely by the
Guadarama Pass on Alba de Tormes. This town the SEVENTY-FIRST
occupied from the 7th to the 13th of November, and during that
period sustained a loss in action with the enemy of one serjeant
and six rank and file killed; one bugler and five rank and file
wounded.

The army having received orders to retire on Portugal, the
battalion abandoned this post, arriving at Coria upon the 1st
of December, where the retreat terminated. In this quarter the
SEVENTY-FIRST continued until the 13th of December, at which time
they were pushed forward to Puerto de Bannos, where they were
joined by a draft of 150 men from the second battalion.

[Sidenote: 1813.]

While stationed at this post, an attempt was made, in February
1813, by the French, to surprise Bejar, then occupied by the
_fiftieth_ regiment. The SEVENTY-FIRST were ordered forward to
support, but previously to their arrival that brave regiment had
driven back the enemy, and completely foiled his efforts.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

On the 18th of March 1813, the second battalion of the
SEVENTY-FIRST embarked at Gravesend for North Britain, and arrived
at Leith on the 23d of that month.

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

Upon the 5th of April the SEVENTY-FIRST changed quarters with the
fiftieth regiment, and continued to occupy Bejar until the 21st of
May, at which period the army broke up from its winter cantonments
for active operations. The battalion on its advance moved by
Salamanca and Toro, and encamped at La Puebla on the 20th of June,
the evening before the memorable battle of _Vittoria_.

Upon the morning of the 21st of June, the two armies being in
position, the SEVENTY-FIRST were ordered to ascend the heights of
La Puebla, to support the Spanish forces under General Morillo.
They accordingly advanced in open column, and having formed
line, were immediately hotly engaged with the enemy, and upon
this occasion suffered an irreparable loss in the fall of their
Commanding Officer the Honorable Colonel Henry Cadogan, who fell
mortally wounded while leading his men to the charge, and being
unable to accompany the battalion, requested to be carried to a
neighbouring eminence, from which he might take a last farewell
of them and the field. In his dying moments he earnestly inquired
if the French were beaten; and on being told by an officer of the
regiment, who stood by supporting him, that they had given way at
all points, he ejaculated, “God bless my brave countrymen” and
immediately expired.[30]

While recording the deep sense of sorrow which the SEVENTY-FIRST
experienced in the demise of a commanding officer who had so often
fought at their head, and whose devoted gallantry had so frequently
called forth their admiration, it is but a meet tribute to the
memory of that brave spirit to extract from the despatch of the
Marquis of Wellington the following expressions of his lordship’s
regret at his loss:

“And I am concerned to report that the Honorable Lieut.-Colonel
Cadogan has died of a wound which he received. In him His Majesty
has lost an officer of great zeal and tried gallantry, who had
already acquired the respect and regard of the whole profession,
and of whom it might be expected, that if he had lived he would
have rendered the most important services to his country.”

After the fall of the Lieut.-Colonel, the SEVENTY-FIRST continued
advancing, and driving the enemy from the heights, until the
force which was opposed to them became so unequal, and the loss
of the battalion so severe, that it was obliged to retire upon
the remainder of the brigade. In the performance of this arduous
duty the battalion suffered very severely, having had one field
officer, one captain, two lieutenants, six serjeants, one bugler,
and seventy-eight rank and file killed; one field officer, three
captains, seven lieutenants, thirteen serjeants, two buglers, and
two hundred and fifty-five rank and file were wounded.

The officers killed were Colonel the Honorable Henry Cadogan,
Captain Henry Hall, Lieutenants Humphrey Fox and Colin Mackenzie.
Those wounded were Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Charles Cother, Captains
Samuel Reed, Joseph Thomas Pidgeon, William Alexander Grant,
Lieutenants Alexander Duff, Loftus Richards, John M^cIntyre,
Charles Cox, William Torriano, Norman Campbell, and Thomas
Commeline.

On this occasion the French suffered a great loss of men, together
with all their artillery, baggage, and stores. King Joseph, whose
carriage and court equipage was seized, had barely time to escape
on horseback. The defeat was the most complete that the French
had sustained in the Peninsula. It was this victory which gained
a bâton for the Marquis of Wellington, who was appointed a Field
Marshal. In a most flattering letter, the Prince Regent, in the
name and behalf of His Majesty, thus conferred the honor: “You have
sent me among the trophies of your unrivalled fame the staff of a
French Marshal, and I send you in return that of England.” This was
in allusion to the bâton of Marshal Jourdan, which was taken by the
eighty-seventh regiment at Vittoria.

The SEVENTY-FIRST subsequently received the Royal authority to bear
the word “VITTORIA” on the regimental colour and appointments, in
commemoration of this signal victory.

When the SEVENTY-FIRST paraded on the morning of the 22d of June,
the dreadful havoc made by the action of the preceding day became
painfully manifest, and an universal gloom was thrown over all, at
missing from their ranks nearly four hundred brave comrades who had
been either killed or wounded on the heights of La Puebla.

The enemy, having been completely beaten at all points, was
forced to retreat in confusion on Pampeluna, and the British army
immediately followed in pursuit. The battalion in this advance
arrived at Pampeluna on the 29th of June, and shortly afterwards
followed, as part of Sir Rowland Hill’s army, a large force of the
enemy, who were retreating into France by the valley of Bastan.
During this forward movement the SEVENTY-FIRST had some skirmishing
in the valley of _Elizondo_, but without loss. Upon the 8th of July
the SEVENTY-FIRST arrived at the heights of Maya, from whence, for
the first time, they had the cheering prospect of beholding the
empire of France extended before them in all its fertile beauty.
Joy was diffused through every heart; every trial and danger were
forgotten while viewing this splendid and gratifying sight. Upon
these heights the battalion was encamped until the 25th of July.

Marshal Soult having been selected by Napoleon for the command
of the French army in Spain, with the rank of “Lieutenant of the
Emperor,” that officer used the most active exertions for its
re-organization, and made immediate arrangements for forcing the
British position in the Pyrenees. With this view he advanced
in person with a large force against the right, stationed at
Roncesvalles, and detached Count D’Erlon with about thirteen
thousand men to attack the position of _Maya_.

The Count D’Erlon, upon the 25th of July, advanced against the
right of the _Maya_ heights, where the ridges of the mountains
branched off towards his camp. The force at this point was not
sufficient to resist such formidable numbers, and the reserve being
posted at some distance to watch passes of importance, which could
not be left wholly unguarded, was brought up by battalions as the
pressure increased.

The intrepidity with which these attacks were met, and the
obstinate bravery with which every inch of ground was disputed,
were obliged at last to yield to overwhelming numbers; but although
the troops were forced to retrograde, yet in their retreat they
took advantage of every rising ground, and disputed it with the
utmost tenacity. At the commencement of this attack a part of
the first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment was detached
to a neighbouring high peak, under the command of Major William
Fitzgerald of the eighty-second regiment, and was strengthened by
a company of that gallant corps. Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir
William Stewart, in his report to Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill,
thus expressed himself respecting these men:--“I cannot too warmly
praise the conduct of that field officer (Major Fitzgerald) and
that of his brave detachment. They maintained the position to the
last; and were compelled, from the want of ammunition, to impede
the enemy’s occupation of the rock by hurling stones at them.”

In another part of this communication, the Lieut.-General
thus alluded to the eighty-second regiment and to the first
brigade, which was composed of the fiftieth, SEVENTY-FIRST, and
ninety-second regiments:

“I feel it my duty to recommend to your attention, and favourable
report to the Commander of the Forces, the conduct and spirit
of Colonel Grant, and of his brave corps, the eighty-second
regiment; also the whole of the first brigade, than which His
Majesty’s army possesses not men of more proved discipline and
courage. The wounds of him, and every commanding officer in that
brigade, were attended with circumstances of peculiar honor to
each of them, and to those under their orders.”

The following is a list of the killed and wounded in the action
of the 25th of July, as nearly as could be ascertained:--Three
serjeants and fifty-four rank and file killed; six serjeants, one
bugler, and seventy-six rank and file wounded.

The SEVENTY-FIRST continued retiring until the 30th, when
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill took up a strong position beyond
Lizasso. In this post they were attacked with much spirit by the
enemy, who, at the same time, by manœuvring on the left flank,
rendered necessary a change of position to a range of heights near
_Eguaros_, which all the efforts of the French failed to carry.
Upon this occasion the SEVENTY-FIRST were seriously engaged,
and had one serjeant and twenty-three rank and file killed; two
serjeants, one bugler, and thirty-three rank and file were wounded.

The enemy having been foiled in all the objects of his attacks,
found it necessary, in his turn, to retreat, moving on the 31st
of July by the pass of _Doña Maria_, where he left a strong corps
in an excellent position. This force was immediately attacked
by the columns of Lieut.-Generals Sir Rowland Hill and the Earl
of Dalhousie, and dislodged, after a gallant resistance. In the
action of this day the first brigade, consisting of the fiftieth,
SEVENTY-FIRST, and ninety-second regiments, had the honor of
bearing its share, and of distinguishing itself. The SEVENTY-FIRST
had one serjeant and twenty-nine rank and file killed; two
serjeants and forty-five rank and file were wounded.

The battalion now returned to the heights of Maya, from whence,
after a halt of a few days, it moved to Roncesvalles.

Previously to this change of quarters, an order was issued by
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, relative to the conduct of the
troops in the actions of the Pyrenees, of which the following is a
copy:--

  “_Arrizi, August 3rd, 1813._

  “GENERAL ORDER.

  “Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill requests that the officers,
  non-commissioned officers, and privates of the corps of the
  army under his command will accept his best thanks for the
  gallant conduct they have displayed during the late active and
  interesting operations.

  “The chance of service has placed the troops under his command
  in situations where they were exposed to an immense superiority
  of forces, a circumstance unavoidable in operations so
  extensive as those in which this army has been engaged; and it
  has at all times been necessary to cede ground to the enemy.
  The Lieut.-General, however, has the satisfaction of knowing
  that the troops have on every occasion maintained their high
  character; that they have only withdrawn from their positions by
  superior orders, and then it has been invariably attended with
  circumstances highly creditable to them. The Lieut.-General has
  not failed to report to the Commander of the Forces the details
  of the several affairs in which the corps have been engaged,
  and he knows that their services are duly appreciated by his
  Excellency.”

The royal authority was subsequently granted to the SEVENTY-FIRST
to bear the word “PYRENEES” on the regimental colour and
appointments, in commemoration of the services of the first
battalion in the actions of the 25th, 30th, and 31st of July, which
have been designated the “_Battles of the Pyrenees_.”

In these actions the SEVENTY-FIRST had Lieutenant Alexander Duff
killed; Major Maxwell Mackenzie, Captains Leslie Walker and
Alexander Grant, Lieutenants Thomas Park, John Roberts, William
Woolcombe, William Peacocke, and Anthony Pack wounded.

The following “Morning Reports” of the 14th of June and 7th of
August, the former being prior to the battle of Vittoria, and the
latter a few days subsequent to the actions in the Pyrenees, will
show how the ranks of the SEVENTY-FIRST were thinned within a
period of less than two months.

                                    =======================

For nearly three months the battalion was encamped on the
heights of Roncesvalles, during which period _St. Sebastian_ and
_Pampeluna_ were captured. The men were principally employed during
this interval in the construction of block-houses and batteries,
and the formation of roads for the artillery.

In the early part of the season the neighbouring heights of
_Altobispo_ were occupied weekly by the brigades of the division;
but as the cold increased with the high winds, the piquets alone
were appointed for this duty. Such was the inclemency of the
weather, and natural advantages of this position, that it was
scarcely thought that the enemy would attempt an attack. This
opinion, however, was ill founded, as upon the night of the 11th
of October an attempt was made by a strong party upon the advance,
composed of fifteen men of the SEVENTY-FIRST, under Serjeant
James Ross. Instead of flinching from an unequal contest, this
small band, relying upon the strength of the position, and being,
moreover, favored by the darkness, which concealed its strength,
maintained its ground, and forced the enemy to retire. The bravery
of this party called forth high encomiums from Lieut.-General the
Honorable Sir William Stewart, commanding the division, and at his
request the soldiers composing it were all presented with medals.

On the 8th of November the division was again in motion, for the
purpose of entering the French territory; and on the 9th of that
month it bivouacked near the heights of Maya, where orders were
received to march as light as possible. The heights were passed
that night by moonlight, for the purpose of joining the grand army;
but the march over bad roads was so fatiguing that when the brigade
arrived in position on the _Nivelle_ it was not called upon to take
an active part in the glorious proceedings of the rest of the army
on the 10th of November, in forcing the French from their fortified
position on that river.

After the battle of the Nivelle, the battalion marched in the
direction of Cambo, on the Nive, where some smart skirmishing
occurred, in which two men were killed, and four serjeants, one
bugler, and forty-one rank and file wounded. When the French
crossed to the right bank, the SEVENTY-FIRST occupied part of the
town of Cambo.

The battalion remained in Cambo for nearly a month, and was here
joined by a detachment of four serjeants and eighty-two rank and
file, under the command of Lieutenant Charles Henderson, from the
second battalion, at this period stationed at Glasgow.

On the 9th of December the first battalion was engaged in the
passage of the _Nive_. The left wing of the SEVENTY-FIRST entered
the river, supported by the fire of the right, and reached the
opposite bank without experiencing any loss.

The enemy now retired within Bayonne, and the corps of
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill was established with its right on
the Adour, the left above the Nive, and the centre at _St. Pierre_,
across the high road to St. Jean Pied-de-Port.

In this disposition the second division, of which the SEVENTY-FIRST
formed part, was placed at St. Pierre. Marshal Soult having
completely failed in an attempt which he made against the left of
the army, moved with his whole force against Sir Rowland Hill’s
corps, with the expectation of overwhelming him before he could be
supported.

The enemy came on with great boldness upon the 13th of December,
and made vigorous efforts against the centre, which he repeatedly
attacked; but at last, finding his most earnest endeavours
fruitless, he drew off. In the action of this day the loss of the
first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment was very severe,
having been placed close to the main road, against which the French
made such formidable and repeated attacks.

Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell Mackenzie, and Lieutenants William
Campbell and Charles Henderson, together with two serjeants, one
bugler, and twenty-three rank and file were killed. Captains Robert
Barclay and William Alexander Grant, and Lieutenants John M^cIntyre
and William Torriano, with thirty-seven rank and file, were wounded.

The following short but highly expressive Division Order was issued
by Lieutenant General the Honorable Sir William Stewart, K.B.:

  “_Head-Quarters, near Petite Moguerre,_
  “_December 14th, 1813._

  “The second division has greatly distinguished itself, and its
  gallantry in yesterday’s action is avowed by the Commander of the
  Forces and the allied army.”

In commemoration of these services, the SEVENTY-FIRST subsequently
received the Royal authority to bear the word “NIVE” on the
regimental colour and appointments.

The battalion marched on the 19th of December to Urcuit, and to Urt
upon the 28th of that month. A small piquet of the SEVENTY-FIRST,
under the command of Corporal Dogherty, here distinguished itself,
by beating off an enemy’s party of nearly treble its strength.

[Sidenote: 1814.]

While stationed in this quarter, the companies were frequently
engaged in skirmishes with the enemy, particularly at St.
Hellette, heights of Garris, and St. Palais, in the month of
January 1814.

In the beginning of February the battalion marched from Urt,
and during its advance had frequent skirmishes with the enemy’s
rear-guard.

On the 26th of February the battalion was in action at
_Sauveterre_, and upon the 27th had the honor of participating in
the battle of _Orthes_.

In commemoration of this victory the SEVENTY-FIRST afterwards
received the Royal authority to bear the word “ORTHES” on the
regimental colour and appointments.

Two divisions of the French army having retired to _Aire_, after
the action of the 27th of February, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill moved upon that town to dislodge them. Upon the 2d of March
the French were found strongly posted upon a ridge of hills,
extending across the great road in front of the town, having their
right on the Adour. The second division attacked them along the
road, seconded by a Portuguese brigade, and drove them from their
position, in gallant style. Lieutenant James Anderson and seventeen
rank and file were killed; Lieutenant Henry Frederick Lockyer, one
serjeant, and nineteen rank and file, were wounded.

A detachment from the second battalion, consisting of one captain,
four subalterns, and a hundred and thirty-four rank and file, under
the command of Major Arthur Jones, joined at Aire.

On the 25th of March part of the battalion was engaged in an affair
at _Tarbes_, in which Lieutenant Robert Law was wounded, and upon
the 10th of April was in position at _Toulouse_, where some of the
companies were employed skirmishing, and sustained a loss of one
serjeant and three rank and file killed; six rank and file were
wounded.

During the night of the 11th of April the French troops evacuated
_Toulouse_, and a white flag was hoisted. On the following day the
Marquis of Wellington entered the city, amidst the acclamations
of the inhabitants. In the course of the afternoon of the 12th of
April intelligence was received of the abdication of Napoleon,
and had not the express been delayed on the journey by the French
police the sacrifice of many valuable lives would have been
prevented.

A disbelief in the truth of this intelligence occasioned much
unnecessary bloodshed at _Bayonne_, the garrison of which made
a desperate _sortie_ on the 14th of April, and Lieutenant Sir
John Hope (afterwards Earl of Hopetoun) was taken prisoner.
Major-General Andrew Hay was killed, and Major-General Stopford was
wounded.

A treaty of peace was established between Great Britain and France;
Louis XVIII. was restored to the throne of France; and Napoleon
Bonaparte was permitted to reside at Elba, the sovereignty of that
island having been conceded to him by the allied powers.

The war being ended, the first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment marched from Toulouse to Blanchfort, where it was encamped
for sixteen days, and afterwards proceeded to Pouillac, where it
embarked on the 15th of July for England, on board of His Majesty’s
ship “Sultan,” of seventy-four guns.

Prior to the breaking up of the Peninsular army, the Duke of
Wellington issued the following General Order:--

  “_Bordeaux, 14th June 1814._

  “GENERAL ORDER.

  “The Commander of the Forces, being upon the point of returning
  to England, again takes this opportunity of congratulating the
  army upon the recent events which have restored peace to their
  country and to the world.

  “The share which the British army have had in producing those
  events, and the high character with which the army will quit
  this country, must be equally satisfactory to every individual
  belonging to it, as they are to the Commander of the Forces, and
  he trusts that the troops will continue the same good conduct to
  the last.

  “The Commander of the Forces once more requests the army to
  accept his thanks.

  “Although circumstances may alter the relations in which he has
  stood towards them for some years so much to his satisfaction, he
  assures them he will never cease to feel the warmest interest in
  their welfare and honor, and that he will be at all times happy
  to be of any service to those to whose conduct, discipline, and
  gallantry their country is so much indebted.”

In addition to the other distinctions acquired during the war
in Spain, Portugal, and the south of France, the SEVENTY-FIRST
subsequently received the Royal authority to bear the word
“PENINSULA” on the regimental colour and appointments.

The first battalion arrived at Cork on the 28th of July, and
marched to Mallow, where it remained for a few days. On the 4th of
August the battalion marched to Limerick, where Colonel Reynell
assumed the command of it in December, and in which city it
continued to be quartered during the remainder of the year.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

The second battalion remained stationed in North Britain.

[Sidenote: 1815.]

[Sidenote: 1st bat.]

In January 1815, the first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment marched from Limerick to Cork, and embarked as part
of an expedition under orders for North America. Peace having
been concluded with the United States, and contrary winds having
prevented the sailing of the vessels, the destination of the
battalion was changed, and subsequent events occasioned its being
employed against its former opponents. The tranquillity which
Europe appeared to have gained by the splendid successes over the
French in the Peninsula was again to be disturbed. Napoleon, who
had been accustomed to imperial sway, was naturally discontented
with his small sovereignty of Elba. Besides, the correspondence
kept up by him with his adherents in France gave him hopes of
regaining his former power, which were, for a short time, fully
realized. Napoleon Bonaparte landed at Cannes, in Provence, on
the 1st of March 1815, with a small body of men, and on the 20th
of that month entered Paris at the head of an army which had
joined him on the road. This could not be matter of wonder, for
the officers and soldiers had won their fame under his command,
and gladly welcomed their former leader, under whom they probably
expected to acquire fresh honors, which might cancel the memory of
the defeats sustained in the Peninsula.

Louis XVIII., unable to stem the torrent, withdrew from Paris
to Ghent, and Napoleon resumed his former dignity of Emperor of
the French. This assumption the allied powers determined not to
acknowledge, and resolved to deprive him of his sovereignty, and
again restore the ancient dynasty.

The first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST, in consequence of these
occurrences, proceeded to the Downs, and was there transhipped into
small craft, which conveyed it to Ostend, where it disembarked on
the 22d of April.

The battalion next proceeded to Ghent, and, after remaining
there a week, marched to Leuze, between Ath and Tournay, and was
subsequently placed in the light brigade with the first battalion
of the fifty-second, six companies of the second and two companies
of the third battalion of the ninety-fifth regiment (Rifles), under
the command of Major-General Frederick Adam, in the division of
Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton.[31]

The strength of the brigade was as follows:--

                             Rank and File.
  52d regt.  1st bat.             997

                               ======

Brevet Colonel Reynell, afterwards Lieut.-General Sir Thomas
Reynell, commanded the battalion at this period.

Napoleon resolved on attacking the Allies before their forces had
been fully collected, and by well-masked and admirably combined
movements, a portion of his army was concentrated on the 14th of
June between the Sambre and the Meuse.

On the morning of the 16th of June, as the battalion was proceeding
to the usual exercising ground of the brigade at Leuze, it received
orders for an immediate advance upon _Nivelles_, where it arrived
late that night. On the same day Prince Blucher had been attacked
at _Ligny_, and was forced to retreat to Wavre. The Duke of
Wellington and a portion of his army had been also attacked at
_Quatre Bras_ by Marshal Ney, who, however, made no impression upon
the British position.

In the course of the morning of the 17th of June, the Duke of
Wellington made a retrograde movement upon _Waterloo_, in order to
keep up his communication with the Prussians. At day-break on the
same morning, the first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST retired, and
broke up its position, with the rest of the allied army, on the
plains in the neighbourhood of _Waterloo_, being situated to the
left and rear of _Hougomont_.

The SEVENTY-FIRST, with the rest of the army, bivouacked in
position during the night of the 17th of June, drenched by the
rain, which fell heavily. Upon the morning of the memorable 18th
of June, the battalion stood in open column, and in this situation
was exposed for some time to a heavy fire of artillery, but a
judicious movement to a short distance alleviated in a great
measure this annoyance. Line was next formed, and about two o’clock
the battalion, with the rest of the brigade, advanced, met their
opponents in position, charged, and instantly overthrew them.

A heavy fire now commenced upon the retreating enemy, but the
_alignement_ having been completely deranged by the impetuosity of
the advance, Colonel Reynell, with his usual coolness, proceeded
to restore order, and had just completed the dressing of the line
when the French cavalry were seen advancing. Square was instantly
formed, and the SEVENTY-FIRST, with the rest of the brigade,
sustained a charge from three regiments of French cavalry, namely,
one of _cuirassiers_, one of _grenadiers-à-cheval_, and one of
lancers.

The charge was made with the most obstinate bravery, but nothing
could overcome the steadiness of the British infantry, and after a
destructive loss, the French were forced to retire.

Previously to this advance, the square of the SEVENTY-FIRST was
struck by a round-shot, which killed or wounded an officer and
eighteen men of the eighth company.

About seven o’clock in the evening the left wing of the battalion
was formed in rear of the right, and, while thus placed, was, with
the rest of the division, attacked by a column of the Imperial
Guard. These troops were fresh, having been kept in reserve during
the day. They were allowed to approach close without molestation,
and the regiments throwing in a close and well-directed fire, they
could not deploy, but broke, and retired in confusion.

The enemy having now exhausted all his efforts, the British, in
their turn, advanced. The SEVENTY-FIRST, in the first instance,
suffered much from the fire of some guns that raked their front;
these were soon silenced, and the battalion was afterwards left
unmolested. In this advance the light brigade captured several
guns. Night closed in fast, and the corps rested after this
lengthened and sanguinary encounter, the pursuit of the discomfited
enemy being committed to the Prussians, under Marshal Blucher, who
had arrived on the field of battle.

The SEVENTY-FIRST had Brevet Major Edmund L’Estrange (Aide-de-Camp
to Major-General Sir Denis Pack, K.C.B.), and Ensign John Todd,
killed. The following officers were wounded: the Lieut.-Colonel
commanding the battalion, Colonel Thomas Reynell; Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Arthur Jones; Captains Samuel Reed, Donald Campbell,
William Alexander Grant, James Henderson, and Brevet-Major Charles
Johnstone; Lieutenants Joseph Barrallier, Robert Lind, John
Roberts, James Coates, Robert Law, Carique Lewin, and Lieutenant
and Adjutant William Anderson.

The number of serjeants, buglers, and rank and file killed amounted
to twenty-nine; one hundred and sixty-six were wounded, and
thirty-six died of their wounds.

Both Houses of Parliament, with the greatest enthusiasm, voted
their thanks to the army “for its distinguished valour at Waterloo.”

For the share which the battalion had in this glorious victory, the
SEVENTY-FIRST were permitted to bear, in common with the rest of
the army engaged upon the 18th of June, the word “WATERLOO” on the
regimental colour and appointments.

The officers and men engaged were presented with silver medals by
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and were allowed to reckon
two years additional service.

The battalion, with the rest of the army, afterwards marched
towards Paris, and entered that city on the 7th of July. The
brigade encamped that day in the _Champs Elysées_, near the Place
Louis Quinze, being the only British troops quartered within the
barriers, and continued there until the beginning of November, when
it proceeded to Versailles, and to Viarmes in December.

Meanwhile Louis XVIII. had entered Paris, and was again reinstated
on the throne of his ancestors. Napoleon Bonaparte had surrendered
to Captain Maitland, commanding the “Bellerophon” British ship
of war, and the island of St. Helena having been fixed for his
residence, he was conveyed thither with a few of his devoted
followers.

[Sidenote: 2d bat.]

On the 24th of December 1815, the second battalion of the
SEVENTY-FIRST was disbanded at Glasgow, the effective officers and
men being transferred to the first battalion.

[Sidenote: 1816.]

In January 1816, the SEVENTY-FIRST marched to the Pas-de-Calais, in
which part of France the regiment was cantoned in several villages,
having its head-quarters at Norrent Fonte, a village on the high
road from Calais to Douay.

On the 21st of June 1816, the regiment assembled upon the _bruyère_
of Rombly, between the villages of Lingham and Rombly on the one
side, and Viterness and Leitre on the other, for the purpose of
receiving the medals which had been granted by His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent to the officers, non-commissioned officers,
buglers, and privates, for their services at the battle of Waterloo.

A hollow square upon the centre was formed on this occasion; the
ranks were opened, and the boxes containing the medals were placed
within the square. Colonel Reynell then addressed the regiment in
the following manner:

  “SEVENTY-FIRST!!

  “The deep interest, which you will all give me credit for
  feeling, in everything that affects the corps cannot fail to be
  awakened upon an occasion such as the present, when holding in
  my hands, to transfer to yours, these honorable rewards bestowed
  by your Sovereign for your share in the great and glorious
  exertions of the army of His Grace the Duke of Wellington upon
  the field of Waterloo, when the utmost efforts of the army of
  France, directed by Napoleon, reputed to be the first captain
  of the age, were not only paralyzed at the moment, but blasted
  beyond the power of even a second struggle.

  “To have participated in a contest crowned with victory so
  decisive, and productive of consequences that have diffused
  peace, security, and happiness throughout Europe, may be to each
  of you a source of honorable pride, as well as of gratitude to
  the Omnipotent Arbiter of all human contests, who preserved you
  in such peril, and without whose protecting hand the battle
  belongs not to the strong, nor the race to the swift.

  “I acknowledge to feel an honest, and, I trust, an excusable,
  exultation, in having had the honor to command you on that day;
  and in dispensing these medals, destined to record in your
  families the share you had in the ever memorable battle of
  WATERLOO, it is a peculiar satisfaction to me that I can present
  them to those by whom they have been fairly and honorably earned,
  and that I can here solemnly declare, that in the course of that
  eventful day I did not observe a soldier of this good regiment
  whose conduct was not only creditable to the English nation, but
  such as his dearest friends could desire.

  “Under such agreeable reflections, I request you to accept
  these medals, and to wear them with becoming pride, as they are
  incontestable proofs of a faithful discharge of your duty to your
  King and your Country. I trust that they will act as powerful
  talismans, to keep you, in your future lives, in the paths of
  honor, sobriety, and virtue.”

At the conclusion of the above address the arms were presented,
“God save the King” was played, and the battalion, by signal, gave
three cheers. Colonel Reynell then, from the lists of companies in
succession, called over the names of those entitled to receive a
medal, and with his own hand placed it in that of the soldier.

[Sidenote: 1817.]

New colours were presented to the regiment on the 13th of January
1817, by Major-General Sir Denis Pack, K.C.B., who made the
following address on the occasion:--

  “SEVENTY-FIRST REGIMENT!

  “Officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, it affords
  me the greatest satisfaction, at the request of your commanding
  officer, Colonel Reynell, to have the honor of presenting these
  colours to you.

  “There are many who could perform the office with a better grace,
  but there is no one, believe me, who is more sensible of the
  merit of the corps, or who is more anxious for its honor and
  welfare.

  “I might justly pay to the valour and good conduct of those
  present the compliments usual on such occasions, but I had
  rather offer the expression of my regard and admiration of
  that excellent _esprit-de-corps_ and real worth which a ten
  years’ intimate knowledge of the regiment has taught me so
  highly to appreciate. I shall always look back with pleasure
  to that long period in which I had the good fortune to be your
  commanding officer, and during which time I received from the
  officers the most cordial and zealous assistance in support of
  discipline; from the non-commissioned officers proofs of the most
  disinterested regard for His Majesty’s service and the welfare of
  their regiment, and I witnessed on the part of the privates and
  the corps at large a fidelity to their colours in South America,
  as remarkable under such trying circumstances as their valour
  has at all times been conspicuous in the field. I am most happy
  to think that there is no drawback to the pleasure all should
  feel on this occasion. Your former colours were mislaid after
  a fête given in London, to celebrate the Duke of Wellington’s
  return after his glorious termination of the peninsular war, and
  your colonel, General Francis Dundas, has sent you three very
  handsome ones to replace them.

  “On them are emblazoned some of His Grace’s victories, in which
  the SEVENTY-FIRST bore a most distinguished part, and more might
  be enumerated which the corps may well be proud of. There are
  still in your ranks valuable officers who have witnessed the
  early glories of the regiment in the East, and its splendid
  career since is fresh in the memory of all. Never, indeed, did
  the character of the corps stand higher; never was the fame
  of the British arms or the glory of the British empire more
  pre-eminent than at this moment, an enthusiastic recollection of
  which the sight of these colours must always inspire.

  “While you have your present commanding officer to lead you, it
  is unnecessary for me to add anything to excite such a spirit;
  but was I called upon to do so, I should have only to hold up the
  example of those who have fallen in your ranks, and, above all,
  point to the memory of that hero who so gloriously fell at your
  head.”[32]

[Sidenote: 1818.]

The regiment formed part of the “Army of Occupation” in France
until towards the end of October 1818, when it embarked at Calais
for England, and arrived at Dover on the 29th of that month.

After landing, the regiment proceeded immediately to Chelmsford,
where it remained for a short time. During its stay at this place
the establishment was reduced from 810 to 650 rank and file.

On the 25th of November the regiment marched to Weedon, Derby, and
Nottingham, having its head-quarters at the former place.

[Sidenote: 1819.]

The regiment was inspected at Weedon on the 1st of May 1819, by
Major-General Sir John Byng, who reported most favourably to His
Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief upon its appearance and
discipline. In consequence of this report His Royal Highness was
pleased to dispense with any further inspection of the regiment
during the year.

On the 21st of June 1819, the regiment marched to Chester, having
detachments at Liverpool and the Isle of Man.

[Sidenote: 1820.]

In June 1820, the regiment marched to Rochdale, Blackburn, and
Burnley. In July following it proceeded to Hertford, Ware,
Hoddesdon, and Hatfield; and on the 20th of November it was removed
to Canterbury.

Previously to the departure of the regiment from Hertford, it was
inspected by the Adjutant-General to the Forces, Major-General
Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B., who communicated to Colonel Sir Thomas
Arbuthnot, K.C.B., commanding the SEVENTY-FIRST, the expression
of the satisfaction experienced by His Royal Highness the
Commander-in-Chief in perusing the report made on that occasion.

[Sidenote: 1821.]

In June 1821, the regiment marched to Chatham, having detachments
at Sheerness, Tilbury Fort, and Harwich. Here a further reduction
took place of two companies, making the establishment to consist of
576 rank and file.

[Sidenote: 1822.]

From Chatham the regiment marched to London, and proceeded by the
canal to Liverpool, there to embark for Dublin, where it arrived on
the 3d of May 1822; the regiment remained in that city until the
beginning of October, when it marched to the south of Ireland. The
head-quarters were stationed at Fermoy, and detachments proceeded
to the villages of Ballahooly, Castletown Roche, Kilworth,
Kildorrory, Wattstown, Glanworth, and Mitchelstown. A subaltern’s
party was also encamped at Glennasheen in the county of Limerick,
the disturbed state of that part of Ireland requiring detachments
in the above posts, and the utmost exertions of every individual
for their protection.

[Sidenote: 1824.]

Lieut.-General Sir Gordon Drummond, G.C.B., was removed from
the colonelcy of the eighty-eighth to that of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment on the 16th of January 1824, in succession to General
Francis Dundas, deceased.

The regiment remained here for two winters, and in the beginning
of May 1824 orders were received to march to the Cove of Cork, to
embark for foreign service.

Before the SEVENTY-FIRST marched to the coast for embarkation,
very gratifying addresses were presented to Colonel Sir Thomas
Arbuthnot, commanding the regiment, from the magistrates and
inhabitants of the district round Fermoy, conveying their
approbation of the conduct of the corps, which had won the esteem
of all classes.

A very gratifying order was also issued by Major-General Sir John
Lambert, K.C.B., commanding the south-western district of Ireland,
relative to the conduct of the regiment.

The regiment embarked for North America on the 14th, 16th, 17th,
and 18th of May 1824, on board the Indian trader Prince of Orange,
Cato and Fanny transports, and anchored at Quebec on the 23d, 24th,
and 25th of June.

[Sidenote: 1825.]

In the year 1825, the establishment of the regiment was augmented
from eight to ten companies, and formed into six _service_ and
four _depôt_ companies, consisting of forty-two sergeants, fourteen
buglers, and 740 rank and file.

In consequence of this arrangement, the officers and
non-commissioned officers of two companies were sent to England to
join the depôt companies at Chichester.

[Sidenote: 1826.]

The detachments stationed during the summer months at the posts of
Sorel and Three Rivers rejoined the head-quarters of the regiment
at Quebec on the 15th of October.

On the 25th of October and the 4th of November, the service
companies were inspected by Lieut.-General the Earl of Dalhousie,
the Commander of the Forces in British North America, who expressed
his fullest approbation of their discipline and interior economy,
as well as of their conduct and appearance.

[Sidenote: 1827.]

The head-quarter division of the SEVENTY-FIRST embarked at Quebec
for Montreal on the 17th of May 1827, after having been stationed
in that garrison nearly three years. Preparatory to this change
of quarters, the service companies were again inspected by
Lieut.-General the Earl of Dalhousie, who, in orders, assured
Lieut.-Colonel Jones that he had never seen any regiment in more
perfect order.

The service companies arrived at Montreal on the 19th of May, and
detachments from them were stationed at Isle-aux-Noix, St. John’s,
William Henry, La Chine, Coteau-du-Lac, and Rideau.

[Sidenote: 1828.]

On the 8th of May 1828, the SEVENTY-FIRST embarked for Kingston in
batteaux, and arrived there on the 16th of that month.

The SEVENTY-FIRST remained stationed here for twelve months. During
the summer and part of the autumn they suffered much from fever
and ague, having had at one period nearly a third of the men in
hospital.

[Sidenote: 1829.]

Upon the 1st of June 1829, the head-quarters embarked in a
steam-boat for York, now called Toronto, the capital of the Upper
Province, and arrived there on the following morning.[33]

One company was detached to Niagara, another to Amherstburg,
and a third to Penetanguishene on Lake Huron. A small number of
men occupied the naval post at Grand River on Lake Erie. The
SEVENTY-FIRST occupied these posts for a period of two years.

On the 10th of August 1829, the depôt companies embarked at
Gravesend for Berwick-on-Tweed.

Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B., was removed from the
colonelcy of the ninety-fifth to that of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment, on the 21st of September 1829, in succession to General
Sir Gordon Drummond, G.C.B., who was appointed to the forty-ninth
regiment.

[Sidenote: 1830.]

In June, 1830, the depôt companies were removed from
Berwick-on-Tweed to Edinburgh Castle.

[Sidenote: 1831.]

In May 1831, the service companies moved down to Quebec, where the
whole were assembled on the 16th of June. After a stay of nearly
five months in that city, orders arrived for the SEVENTY-FIRST to
proceed to Bermuda. The service companies embarked on the 20th of
October 1831 in the transports Layton and Manlius, and arrived
off St. George’s, Bermuda, upon the 11th of November, when they
immediately disembarked, sending a detachment of one captain, two
subalterns, and a hundred and twenty men to Ireland Island.

The head-quarters were subsequently moved to Hamilton, and small
parties were detached to the signal posts at Gibbs Hill and Mount
Langton.

[Sidenote: 1833.]

During the years 1832 and 1833, the service companies continued at
Bermuda, and the depôt remained in North Britain.

On the 30th of August 1833, Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Charles
Grey exchanged from the half-pay to the SEVENTY-FIRST Regiment with
Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Thomas Pidgeon.

[Sidenote: 1834.]

The tartan plaid scarf was restored to the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment
by an authority (under the King’s Sign Manual) dated 17th of
February 1834.

On the 11th of September 1834, the service companies embarked
at Bermuda for Great Britain, and arrived at Leith on the 19th
of October following. The regiment was afterwards stationed at
Edinburgh, where it remained during the year 1835.

[Sidenote: 1836.]

The regiment embarked at Glasgow on the 11th of May 1836 for
Ireland, and was stationed at Dublin during the remainder of the
year.

[Sidenote: 1837.]

In June 1837, the regiment proceeded from Dublin to Kilkenny.

[Sidenote: 1838.]

Major-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham, K.C.B., was appointed
Colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment on the 28th of March 1838, in
succession to Lieut.-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B., appointed
to the thirty-first regiment.

Meanwhile orders had been received for the regiment to proceed on
foreign service, and on the 20th of April 1838 the six service
companies embarked at Cork for Canada. The four depôt companies
remained in Ireland.

[Sidenote: 1839.]

On the 2d of June 1839 the depôt companies embarked at Cork for
North Britain, and were afterwards stationed at Stirling.

The establishment of the regiment was augmented on the 12th of
August 1839, from seven hundred and forty to eight hundred rank and
file.

[Sidenote: 1840.]

During the year 1840 the service companies were stationed at St.
John’s, Lower Canada. The depôt companies proceeded from Stirling
to Dundee in April.

[Sidenote: 1841.]

Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Reynell, Bart., K.C.B., was removed from
the colonelcy of the eighty-seventh Royal Irish fusiliers to that
of the SEVENTY-FIRST or HIGHLAND regiment on the 15th of March
1841, in succession to Lieut.-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham,
K.C.B. and K.C.H., deceased.

In May 1841 the depôt companies proceeded from Dundee to Aberdeen.

Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Charles Grey exchanged to half-pay
with Lieut.-Colonel James England on the 8th of April 1842.

[Sidenote: 1842.]

The service companies proceeded from St. John’s to Montreal, in two
divisions, on the 27th and 28th of April 1842.

In consequence of the augmentation which took place in the army at
this period, the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment was ordered to be divided
into two battalions, the six service companies being termed the
first battalion, and the depôt, augmented by two new companies,
being styled the reserve battalion. The depôt was accordingly
moved from Stirling to Chichester in 1842, and after receiving one
hundred and eighty volunteers from other corps, was there organised
into a battalion for foreign service.

[9] The following allusion to Captain Gilchrist is made by Captain
_Munro_, in his _Narrative_:--

“Here our regiment had the misfortune of burying Captain Gilchrist,
a brave and experienced officer, whose loss the SEVENTY-THIRD
had much cause to lament, he having always acted as a mentor to
the young and inexperienced gentlemen of his corps. This veteran
had the honor, when a subaltern, of witnessing the exploits of
General Wolfe upon the plains of Quebec, and was now at the head
of our grenadier company; but, having exerted himself too much
upon the march to Conjeveran, he was seized at that place with a
fever, which disabling him from conducting the grenadiers upon the
detachment under Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher, affected his mind so
deeply, particularly when he heard of their dismal fate, that a
delirium came on during this march, of which he died, regretted and
justly lamented by all.”

[10] Lieut.-Colonel James Craufurd, of the SEVENTY-THIRD regiment,
was promoted to the local rank of Colonel in the East Indies on the
22d March 1780.

Coast, against the combined forces of the French, Dutch, and
Hyder Ali, from 1780 to 1784, by Captain Innes Munro, of the
_Seventy-third_ or Lord Macleod’s Regiment of Highlanders.

[13] The following is extracted from a letter, dated 28th January
1782, from Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, K.B., then at Fort
George, Madras, addressed to the Earl of Shelburne, one of His
Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State:--

“Colonel Craufurd, of His Majesty’s SEVENTY-THIRD regiment, having
had my leave to return to Europe, will have the honor of delivering
your lordship this letter.

“I should do injustice to the high sense I entertain of Colonel
Craufurd’s merit as an officer, did I omit on this occasion
mentioning how much he has acquitted himself to my satisfaction,
and with honor and credit to himself, in the whole course of a
most trying campaign. He was next in command to me at the battle
of Sholingur, on which occasion his conduct was deserving of the
highest applause.”

[14] Major John Elphinston, of the SEVENTY-THIRD regiment, was
promoted to the local rank of lieutenant-colonel in the East Indies
on the 23d of May 1781.

[15] _Droog_ signifies a fortified hill or rock.

[16] In 1794 Tippoo received back his sons, and immediately
commenced secret negotiations with the French, who were then at
war with Great Britain, in order to renew measures for “utterly
destroying the English in India.” This animosity ended only with
the death of the Sultan, which took place on the 4th of May 1799,
while defending Seringapatam against his former opponents. His body
was found amidst heaps of slain, and was interred in the mausoleum
which he had erected over the tomb of his father, Hyder Ali, a
portion of the victorious troops attending the ceremony.

[17] On the 23d of May 1821, His Majesty King George the Fourth
was graciously pleased to authorise the SEVENTY-FIRST to bear on
the regimental colour and appointments the word “HINDOOSTAN,” in
commemoration of its distinguished services in the several actions
in which it had been engaged, while in India, between the years
1780 and 1797.

[18] In consequence of the renewal of the war with France, in
May 1803, the British Government introduced the “Army of Reserve
Act,” which was passed in July following, for raising men for
home service by ballot, and thus caused certain regiments to be
augmented to two battalions. Volunteer and yeomanry corps were also
formed in every part of the kingdom, in order to preserve Great
Britain from the threatened invasion.

[20] The lofty promontory of Southern Africa received the name of
“_Cabo da Boa Esperança_” (_Cape of Good Hope_), from King John
II. of Portugal, upon its discovery, in 1487, by Bartholomew Diaz,
in consequence of a _good hope_ being entertained of discovering
the long-wished for passage to India, which ten years afterwards
was realised by Vasco de Gama, who doubled the Cape, and continued
the voyage to the Malabar coast. For more than a century the Cape
continued as a temporary rendezvous for European mariners. In July
1620, Humphrey Fitzherbert and Andrew Shillinge, two of the East
India Company’s commanders, took formal possession of the place, in
the name of King James I., but no settlement was formed. In 1650
the government of the Netherlands resolved to colonize the Cape,
which remained in possession of the Dutch until July 1795, when it
was taken by the British for the Prince of Orange, but was restored
to its former possessors by the Peace of Amiens, concluded in 1802.
It was again captured by the British in 1806, in whose possession
it has since remained.

[21] Lieut.-Colonel Pack’s narrative of his escape is inserted in
the Appendix, page 158.

[22] Lieut.-General Sir Harry Burrard landed during the action, but
did not assume the command. Lieut.-General Sir Hew Dalrymple landed
on the following day, and took command of the army. The force under
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore was also disembarked during the
negotiation, which subsequently took place, making the British army
amount to thirty-two thousand men.

of February 1809; also a list of regiments employed under
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore at Corunna, inserted in pages 161,
&c. of the _Appendix_.

[25] The bonnet _cocked_ is the pattern cap to which allusion
is made in the above letter. This was in accordance with
Lieut.-Colonel Pack’s application; and with respect to retaining
the pipes, and dressing the pipers in the Highland garb, he added,
“It cannot be forgotten how these pipes were obtained, and how
constantly the regiment has upheld its title to them. These are the
honorable characteristics which must preserve to future times the
precious remains of the old corps, and of which I feel confident
His Majesty will never have reason to deprive the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment.”

[26] The remaining four companies of the first battalion of the
SEVENTY-FIRST regiment arrived in the Peninsula in the course of
the year 1811, namely, two companies in March, and two in July 1811.

[27] Major General William Carr Beresford, marshal in the
Portuguese service, was appointed a Knight of the Bath on the 16th
of October 1810.

[28] Lieut.-General Rowland Hill was appointed a Knight of the
Order of the Bath on the 22d of February 1812.

[29] When Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill was created a Peer in
May 1814, his title was connected with the gallant affair above
recorded, as he was styled Baron Hill of Almaraz, and of Hawkstone,
in the county of Salop.

[30] The officers of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, to mark their
admiration and esteem for this distinguished officer, had a
monument erected to his memory.

[33] During the period the SEVENTY-FIRST were stationed at York,
they had the satisfaction of removing to consecrated ground the
mortal remains of the brave grenadiers of the eighth regiment,
who fell upon the 27th of April, 1813, in action with the
Americans. These gallant soldiers had fallen, and were buried at
a considerable distance from the shores of Lake Ontario; but as
its waters had since encroached upon the land in this direction,
they at length succeeded in breaking open their honorable grave,
and the beach became strewed with their remains. This coming to
the knowledge of the SEVENTY-FIRST, they had them removed to the
military burying ground in the vicinity of the garrison.




SUCCESSION OF COLONELS

OF THE

SEVENTY-FIRST REGIMENT,

HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY.


JOHN LORD MACLEOD,

_Appointed 19th December 1777_.

Lord John Macleod was the eldest son of the Earl of Cromartie,
and, with his father, was engaged in the attempt made in 1745 by
Prince Charles Edward, the young pretender, to recover the throne
of his ancestors. After the battle of Culloden, in 1746, the Earl
of Cromartie was brought to trial, and pleaded guilty; but his life
was spared on consideration of the remorse expressed by him for
having been seduced in an unguarded moment from that loyalty which
he had always, previously to the breaking out of the rebellion,
evinced to the existing establishment, both in Church and State.
Lord Macleod also received the royal mercy on account of his youth,
and his regard for his parent, which had been the cause of his
being concerned in the rebellion. The young lord also promised,
that, should the royal clemency be extended to him, that his future
life and fortune should be entirely devoted to His Majesty’s
service, which promise was amply fulfilled in after years. Lord
Macleod subsequently entered into the Swedish army, where he served
for several years with great reputation, and was made a Commandant
of the Order of the Sword in the kingdom of Sweden. While the
American war of independence was being carried on, his Lordship
returned to Great Britain, and in December 1777 received authority
to raise a regiment of Highlanders, which was, on its formation,
numbered the seventy-third, and subsequently the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment, under the circumstances detailed in the Historical
Record. His Lordship was appointed colonel of the newly raised
regiment, to which a second battalion was added in September 1778,
and embarked with the first battalion for India in January 1779,
arriving at Madras in January 1780. The war with Hyder Ali, the
powerful Sultan of the Mysore territory, commenced in that year,
and his Lordship served under Major-General Sir Hector Munro in the
first instance, and afterwards under Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote.
On the 1st of June 1781, Colonel Lord Macleod was promoted to the
local rank of major-general in the East Indies, in which year he
returned to England, some misunderstanding having arisen between
his Lordship and Major-General Stuart concerning priority of rank.
His Lordship was promoted to the rank of major-general on the 20th
of November 1782. On the forfeited estates being restored, in 1784,
Major-General Lord Macleod obtained the family estate of Cromartie.
His decease occurred on the 2d of April 1789, at Edinburgh.


THE HONORABLE WILLIAM GORDON,

_Appointed 9th April 1789_.

The Honorable William Gordon was appointed captain in the Sixteenth
Light Dragoons, when that corps was raised in the year 1759.
In October 1762, he was appointed Lieut.-Colonel of the 105th
regiment, and in 1777, he was promoted to the colonelcy of the
eighty-first regiment, which was afterwards disbanded. In 1781 he
was promoted to the rank of major-general, and in April 1789 was
nominated colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST Highlanders. He was advanced
to the rank of lieut.-general in 1793, to that of general in 1798,
and was removed to the Twenty-first Royal North British Fusiliers
in 1803. He died in 1816.


SIR JOHN FRANCIS CRADOCK, G.C.B. AND K.C.,

afterwards

LORD HOWDEN,

_Appointed 6th August 1803_.

This officer entered the army on the 15th of December 1777, as a
cornet in the fourth regiment of horse, now the seventh dragoon
guards; and on the 9th of July 1779, he exchanged to an ensigncy in
the Coldstream guards, in which he was promoted to a lieutenancy,
with the rank of captain, on the 12th of December 1781. On the 25th
of June 1785, he was advanced to the rank of major of the twelfth
dragoons, and on the 16th of September 1786, exchanged into the
thirteenth foot, of which regiment he was appointed lieut.-colonel
on the 16th of June 1789. Lieut.-Colonel Cradock commanded the
thirteenth regiment in the West Indies, and on his return, in
1792, was appointed quartermaster-general in Ireland, where he was
specially employed by Government in many of the disturbed counties.
He went a second time to the West Indies, in the command of the
second battalion of grenadiers, under the orders of General Sir
Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, and was present at the reduction
of Martinique (where he was wounded), St. Lucia, Guadaloupe, and
at the siege of Fort Bourbon. Before the reduction of the second
battalion of grenadiers in the West Indies he was appointed by Sir
Charles Grey to be his aide-de-camp, and on his return to England
he received the thanks of Parliament for his services.

On the 26th of February 1795, Lieut.-Colonel Cradock received the
brevet rank of colonel, and on the 16th of April following was
appointed colonel of the one hundred and twenty-seventh regiment,
which was disbanded in 1798, when he was placed on half pay.

On the 1st of January 1798, Colonel Cradock was advanced to the
rank of major-general, and served as quartermaster-general in
Ireland during the rebellion of that year; was under the command
of Lieut.-General Gerard (afterwards Viscount) Lake at the affair
with the rebels at Vinegar Hill, and in the subsequent movements
in the county of Wexford. Major-General Cradock accompanied Earl
Cornwallis as quartermaster-general in his lordship’s march against
the French forces that landed in Killala under General Humbert,
and was severely wounded in the action at Ballynahinch, when the
French and rebel force were defeated, and laid down their arms.

Major-General Cradock was afterwards appointed to the staff of the
Mediterranean, under General Sir Ralph Abercromby, and proceeded on
the expedition to Egypt, and was in the actions of the 8th, 13th,
and 21st of March 1801. In that of the 13th, near Alexandria, he
commanded the brigades which formed the advance against the enemy,
and received the thanks of Sir Ralph Abercromby. He was second in
command of the division of the army that proceeded to Cairo under
the command of Lieut.-General Hutchinson (afterwards the Earl of
Donoughmore), and was at the action of Rhamanie on the 9th of May
1801, and at the surrender of Cairo and Alexandria. The surrender
of the latter place on the 2d of September following, terminated
the campaign, after which he was appointed to the command of a
force of 4,000 men, to proceed to Corfu; but the preliminaries of
peace being signed on the 1st of October between Great Britain and
France, put an end to the expedition, and he returned to England,
when he was again honored with the thanks of Parliament. The Grand
Seignior had also established the order of knighthood of the
Crescent, of which the general officers who served in Egypt were
made members.

On the 8th of May 1801, Major-General Cradock had been appointed
colonel commandant of the fifty-fourth regiment, and upon the
reduction of the army, in 1802, he was placed on half-pay. On the
6th of August 1803, he was appointed colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment.

On the 1st of January 1805, Major-General Sir John Cradock,
K.B., was advanced to the rank of lieut.-general, and appointed
to the command of the forces at Madras. Upon the departure from
India of General Lord Lake, in 1806, Lieut.-General Sir John
Cradock remained for nearly a year in the command of the forces
in that country. In 1808 he was appointed to command the forces
in Portugal, during the critical period preceding the arrival of
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, and was afterwards appointed
Governor of Gibraltar, which in a short time he resigned. On the
6th of January 1809, he was removed from the SEVENTY-FIRST to the
colonelcy of the forty-third regiment. In 1811 he was appointed
governor of the Cape of Good Hope, and commander of the forces on
that station, which he held until 1814, on the 4th of June of which
year he was promoted to the rank of general.

General Sir John Cradock was nominated a Knight Grand Cross of
the Order of the Bath on the 2d of January 1815, and in 1819 was
created a peer of Ireland, by the title of Baron Howden. At the
coronation of His Majesty King William IV. he was advanced to
the dignity of a Peer of the United Kingdom. By royal licence he
afterwards altered his name to Caradoc, deeming that to be the
ancient and veritable orthography. The decease of General the
Right Honorable John Francis Caradoc, Baron Howden of Howden and
Grimstone in the county of York, and of Cradockstown, county of
Kildare, occurred on the 26th of July 1839, at the advanced age of
eighty years.


FRANCIS DUNDAS,

_Appointed 7th January 1809._

The first commission of this officer was an ensigncy in the first
foot guards, dated 4th of April 1775, and in May 1777 he joined
the army in North America, was present at the battle of Brandywine
on the 11th of September of that year, and in that of Germantown
on the 4th of October following, also at the siege of ten forts
on the river Delaware, and after their reduction in December the
detachment of guards employed on that service rejoined the army,
and went into winter quarters at Philadelphia. On the 23d of
January 1778 he received a lieutenancy, with the rank of captain,
in the first foot guards. Captain Dundas served the campaign of
that year, and was present in the action of Monmouth Court-House on
the 28th of June 1778, fought during the march of the British army
from Philadelphia to New York, in which the second battalion of the
first foot guards was principally engaged. Having soon after been
appointed to the light company of that corps, he was employed on
various detached services in 1778 and 1779, in the course of which
the company to which he belonged sustained considerable losses.

The corps of guards being detached into South Carolina, joined the
army under Lieut.-General the Earl Cornwallis, in 1780, and the
light company forming his lordship’s advanced guard, it was almost
every day engaged. Captain Dundas commanded it at the battle of
Guildford and at York Town.

Captain Dundas was promoted to a company in the first foot guards,
with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, on the 11th of April 1783,
and on the 6th of June following exchanged into the forty-fifth
regiment, from which he was transferred to the first foot on the
31st of March 1787. With the first battalion of the latter regiment
Lieut.-Colonel Dundas embarked for Jamaica in January 1790, and
returned to England in July 1791. In October 1793 he was appointed
aide-de-camp to King George III., and received the brevet rank of
colonel.

Colonel Dundas was employed in that rank in the West Indies as
adjutant-general to the army under General Sir Charles (afterwards
Earl) Grey, and was present at the siege of Martinique and the
other adjacent islands in 1794. Upon his return to England, being
appointed on the 9th of October 1794, colonel of the Scots brigade,
afterwards numbered the ninety-fourth regiment, he joined it in
Scotland, and raised a new battalion.

Major-General Dundas, to which rank he was advanced on the 26th
of February 1795, was employed on the staff in North Britain
until ordered to join the army preparing for foreign service
under Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, at Southampton. Having
returned to Portsmouth with the expedition, he was soon afterwards
appointed to the command at the Cape of Good Hope, and in August
1796 he embarked for that colony. Being appointed lieut.-governor,
with the command of the troops under the governor, he continued
to hold that appointment until Lord Macartney returned to England
in November 1798, leaving him to act as civil governor. Upon
the arrival of Lord Macartney’s successor, in December 1799,
Major-General Dundas resumed his former situation; but that officer
being recalled in 1801, the civil with the military authority
again devolved on Major-General Dundas, and he held both until the
Cape was restored to the Dutch by the treaty of peace concluded
in 1803. Upon his return to England in June 1803, Lieut.-General
Dundas, to which rank he had been promoted on the 29th of April of
the previous year, was placed on the staff in the southern district
of Great Britain, under General Sir David Dundas, K.B. Towards the
end of 1805 Lieut.-General Dundas was appointed to the command of
a division ordered to join the army assembling in Hanover under
Lieut.-General Lord Cathcart, and on his return, in 1806, he was
again appointed to the staff in the southern district. On the
7th of January 1809, Lieut.-General Dundas was appointed by His
Majesty to be colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, and on the 1st
of January 1812 was advanced to the rank of general. He had been
appointed governor of Carrickfergus in Ireland in 1787, and was
transferred in January 1817 to the governorship of Dumbarton Castle
in Scotland.

The decease of General Dundas occurred at Edinburgh on the 16th of
January 1824.


SIR GORDON DRUMMOND, G.C.B.

_Appointed 16th January 1824._

Removed to the forty-ninth regiment on the 21st of September 1829,
and to the eighth foot on the 24th of April 1846.


SIR COLIN HALKETT, K.C.B.

_Appointed 21st September 1829._

Removed to the thirty-first regiment on the 28th of March 1838, and
to the forty-fifth regiment on the 12th of July 1847.


SIR SAMUEL FORD WHITTINGHAM,

_Appointed 28th March 1838._

This officer was appointed ensign in the sixty-sixth regiment
on the 20th of January 1803, lieutenant in the ninth foot on
the 25th of February, and was removed to the first life guards
on the 10th of March of the same year. On the 14th of February
1805 he was promoted to the rank of captain in the twenty-eighth
regiment, and was removed to the thirteenth light dragoons on
the 13th of June following, and in 1809 was appointed deputy
assistant quartermaster-general in the army in the Peninsula
under Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. In March 1810, Captain
Whittingham was promoted to the rank of major, serving with the
Portuguese army. He was subsequently employed in America; but
the chief scene of his services was with the army in Spain, for
which he was peculiarly qualified by his perfect knowledge of the
Spanish language. He was first permitted to join that service as
aide-de-camp to General Castanos, and in that capacity shared in
the battle and victory of Baylen. Major Whittingham afterwards
served under the Duke of Albuquerque, and was severely wounded at
Talavera. Soon afterwards he obtained the command of the Spanish
cavalry, and was present at the battle of Barrosa, fought on the
5th of March 1811. On the 30th of May following he was promoted
lieut.-colonel in the Portuguese army. He was next intrusted to
raise and command a large corps of Spanish troops clothed and paid
by the British Government. In 1812, as major-general in command
of this well-disciplined corps, he was, in junction with the
British army at Alicant, successfully opposed to Marshal Suchet,
and was again wounded at the battle of Castalla; after which he
served with distinction in command of a division of infantry
under Lieut.-General Sir John Murray, and subsequently under
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck on the eastern coast of Spain.

At the restoration of peace in 1814, Lieut.-Colonel Whittingham
returned to England, his conduct in Spain being reported in very
flattering terms by the British ambassador in Spain and by the
Duke of Wellington. On the 4th of June 1814, he was appointed
aide-de-camp to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, with the rank
of colonel in the army; and was appointed a Companion of the Order
of the Bath, with the honor of knighthood, on the 4th of June 1815.

Upon the return of Napoleon from Elba in March 1815, Colonel
Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham returned to the Peninsula, at the
particular request of the King of Spain, and on his arrival at
Madrid, he was invested with the Grand Cross of the Order of
San Fernando. In the year 1819 he was appointed governor of
Dominica, and in 1822 his services were transferred to India as
quartermaster-general of the king’s troops; he subsequently held
the command as major-general, to which rank he was promoted on the
27th of May 1825, successively in the Cawnpoor and Meerut divisions.

Major-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham served at the siege of
Bhurtpore, which was captured in January 1826; and received the
thanks of Parliament for his conduct on that occasion. He was also
nominated a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on the 26th
of December following.

Having returned from India in 1835, Major-General Sir Samuel
Ford Whittingham was appointed to the command of the forces in
the Windward and Leeward Islands in 1836. On the 28th of March
1838, he was appointed colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST Regiment,
and on the 28th of June following was advanced to the rank of
lieut.-general. He was permitted to resign the Windward and Leeward
command in 1839, in order to undertake the command-in-chief at
Madras, receiving at the same time from General Lord Hill, then
commanding-in-chief, a flattering testimonial of his services while
in the West Indies.

Lieut.-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham arrived at Madras on the
1st of August 1840, where he continued until the 19th of January
1841, the date of his decease.


SIR THOMAS REYNELL, BART., K.C.B.

_Appointed 15th March 1841._

This distinguished officer commenced his military career as an
ensign in the thirty-eighth regiment, his commission being dated
the 30th of September 1793. He joined the regiment in January 1794
at Belfast, and in April proceeded with it to Flanders, where it
formed part of the army commanded by His Royal Highness the Duke
of York. On arrival at the seat of war, the thirty-eighth regiment
was ordered to join the corps under the Austrian General Count
Clèrfait, who commanded the troops in West Flanders, and it was
attached to the division under Major-General Hammerstein, together
with the eighth light dragoons and twelfth foot. Ensign Reynell
was present in the action on the heights of Lincelles on the 18th
of May, and at the battle of Hoglade on the 13th of June 1794. He
afterwards served with the army under the Duke of York, and was
in Nimeguen when that town was besieged. On the 3d of December
following, when cantoned between the rivers Rhine and the Waal,
he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the thirty-eighth
regiment. Lieutenant Reynell served during the winter campaign
of 1795, and retreat through Westphalia to the Weser, and there
embarked for England. He accompanied the thirty-eighth regiment
to the West Indies in May 1796, and was present at the capture of
the island of Trinidad in the early part of 1797. On the 22d of
July 1797 he was promoted to a company in the second West India
regiment, and joined that corps at Grenada.

Captain Reynell quitted Grenada early in 1798, in consequence of
being appointed assistant adjutant-general at St. Domingo, where
he remained until that island was evacuated by the British in
September, when he returned to England. In the beginning of 1799 he
revisited St. Domingo, as one of the suite of Brigadier-General the
Honorable Thomas Maitland, then employed in framing a commercial
treaty with the negro chief Toussaint L’Ouverture, who had risen
to the supreme authority at St. Domingo. When it was concluded,
Captain Reynell returned to England in July of the same year.

On the 8th of August 1799 Captain Reynell was transferred to a
company in the fortieth regiment, with the first battalion of
which he embarked for the Helder in that month, and joined the
army, which was at first commanded by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph
Abercromby, and afterwards by the Duke of York. Captain Reynell was
present in the action of the 10th of September; also in the battle
of the 19th of September, when he was the only captain of the first
battalion of the fortieth regiment that was not killed or wounded;
he was also present in the subsequent battles of the 2d and 6th of
October. Captain Reynell, upon the British army being withdrawn
from Holland, re-embarked with the first battalion of the fortieth
regiment, and arrived in England in November 1799.

In April 1800 Captain Reynell embarked with his regiment for
the Mediterranean, and went in the first instance to Minorca,
afterwards to Leghorn; returned to Minorca, and proceeded with a
large force under Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby for the
attack of Cadiz. Signals for disembarking were made; but although
the boats had actually put off from the ships, a recall was
ordered, in consequence of the plague raging at Cadiz. After this
he proceeded up the Mediterranean again, and in November landed at
Malta.

The flank companies of the fortieth regiment having been allowed
to volunteer their services in the expedition to Egypt, Captain
Reynell proceeded thither in command of the light company (one of
the four flank companies detached under Colonel Brent Spencer),
and was present in the action at the landing on the 8th of March
1801. On this occasion the flank companies of the fortieth were
on the right of the line, and were particularly noticed for the
gallant style in which they mounted the sand-hills immediately
where they landed. Captain Reynell was present in the battle of
the 13th of March, and commanded the right out-piquet of the
army, in the morning of the 21st of that month, when the French
attacked the British near Alexandria, on which occasion General
Sir Ralph Abercromby was mortally wounded. Soon after Captain
Reynell proceeded with a small British corps and some Turkish
battalions to Rosetta, of which easy possession was taken. He was
present in an action at Rhamanie, and followed the French to Grand
Cairo, where that part of their army capitulated; and returned as
escort in charge of the French troops to Rosetta; and after they
had embarked he joined the force under Major-General Sir Eyre
Coote before Alexandria. The surrender of Alexandria, on the 2d of
September 1801, terminated the campaign, for his services in which
he received the gold medal conferred by the Grand Seignior on the
several officers employed.

Captain Reynell was afterwards appointed aide-de-camp to
Major-General Cradock, who was ordered to proceed from Egypt
with a force of four thousand men to Corfu; but while at sea
counter-orders were received, and he proceeded to Malta, and
subsequently to England. In July 1804 he embarked as aide-de-camp
to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, K.B., who had been appointed
to the command of the troops at Madras, and while on the passage,
namely, the 3d of August 1804, he was promoted to the rank of major
in the fortieth regiment.

On the 10th of March 1805 Major Reynell received the brevet rank of
lieut.-colonel, upon being appointed deputy quartermaster-general
to the King’s troops in the East Indies. In July following he was
appointed aide-de-camp to the Marquis Cornwallis, governor-general
of India, and accompanied his lordship from Madras to Bengal,
with whom he remained until his lordship’s decease, at Ghazepore,
in October 1805. Lieut.-Colonel Reynell returned to Madras
immediately afterwards, and was appointed military secretary to the
Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, the commander-in-chief at that
presidency. He officiated during several months of the year 1806
as deputy adjutant-general in India, in which country he remained
until October 1807, when he returned with Lieut.-General Sir John
Cradock to Europe, and arrived in England in April 1808.

Lieut.-Colonel Reynell resigned the appointment of deputy
quartermaster-general in India, and was brought on full pay as
major of the ninety-sixth regiment on the 5th May 1808, and on the
22d of September following was appointed major in the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment.

In October 1808, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell embarked as military
secretary to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, who had been
appointed to command the forces in Portugal, and landed in November
at Lisbon. He remained in Portugal until April 1809, when Sir John
Cradock was superseded in the command of the forces in Portugal
by Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. Lieut.-Colonel Reynell
afterwards accompanied Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock to Cadiz,
Seville, and Gibraltar, of which latter place Sir John Cradock was
appointed governor, and Lieut.-Colonel Reynell remained there as
military secretary until September, when he returned to England.

Lieut.-Colonel Reynell joined the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment at
Brabourne-Lees Barracks in December 1809, immediately after its
return from Walcheren. In September 1810 he embarked at Deal with
six companies of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment for Portugal, landed at
Lisbon towards the end of that month, marched soon after to Mafra,
and thence to Sobral, where the six companies joined the army under
Lieut.-General Viscount Wellington. In October Lieut.-Colonel
Reynell had the honor of being particularly mentioned by Viscount
Wellington in his despatch, containing an account of the repulse
of the attack of the French at Sobral on the 14th of that month.
The British army shortly afterwards retired to the lines of Torres
Vedras, and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell was appointed assistant
adjutant-general to the fourth division under Major-General the
Honorable George Lowry Cole.

Early in March 1811, the army of Marshal Massena broke up from its
entrenched position at Santarem, and retreated to the northward.
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell entered Santarem with the fourth
division the day after Marshal Massena had left it, and continued
in the pursuit of the French army to the Mondego. In the affair of
Redinha he had a horse killed under him. From Espinhal the fourth
division was ordered to retrograde, and recross the Tagus, for
the purpose of reinforcing Marshal Sir William Carr Beresford. In
1811 he joined the Marshal at Portalegre, and being the senior
British assistant adjutant-general, was directed to join Marshal
Beresford’s head-quarters, and proceeded with him to Campo Mayor,
from which the enemy retired; was also present at the capture
of Olivença, and subsequently accompanied the marshal to Zafra,
between which place and Llerena a smart skirmish occurred with the
enemy’s hussars. In May 1811, Lieut.-Colonel Reynell returned to
England from Lisbon with despatches from Viscount Wellington.

In July 1811, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell embarked as military
secretary to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, K.B., who had been
appointed governor and commander of the forces at the Cape of Good
Hope, where he arrived by the end of September. On the 4th of June
1813, he received the brevet rank of colonel; and on the 5th of
August 1813, he was promoted lieut.-colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry
Cadogan, who was mortally wounded in the battle of Vittoria; in
February following, being desirous of joining the corps, Colonel
Reynell resigned his staff situation at the Cape, and proceeded to
England, where he arrived in May 1814. In July of that year he was
appointed adjutant-general to the force then preparing for service
in America under Lieut.-General Lord Hill; but, other operations
being then in view, that appointment was cancelled.

Colonel Reynell took the command of the first battalion of the
SEVENTY-FIRST regiment at Limerick in December 1814, and embarked
with it from Cork in January of the following year, as part of an
expedition for North America; but peace having been concluded with
the United States, and contrary winds having prevented the sailing
of the vessels, the destination of the battalion was changed. In
March Colonel Reynell received orders to proceed with his battalion
to the Downs, where, in the middle of April, it was transhipped
into small vessels, and sent immediately to Ostend, to join the
army forming in Flanders, in consequence of Napoleon Bonaparte
having returned from Elba to France.

In the memorable battle of Waterloo, fought on the 18th of June
1815, Colonel Reynell commanded the first battalion of the
SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, and was wounded in the foot on that
occasion. He afterwards succeeded to the command of Major-General
Adam’s brigade, consisting of the first battalions of the
fifty-second and SEVENTY-FIRST, with six companies of the second,
and two companies of the third battalion of the ninety-fifth
regiment, in consequence of that officer being wounded. Colonel
Reynell commanded the light brigade in the several operations that
took place on the route to Paris, and entered that capital at the
head of the brigade on the 7th of July 1815, and encamped with it
in the _Champs Elysées_, being the only British troops quartered
within the barriers. In this year he was appointed a Companion
of the Order of the Bath, and received the Cross of a Knight of
the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theresa, also a Cross of the
fourth class of the Russian Military Order of St. George.

Colonel Reynell remained with the “_Army of Occupation_” in
France until October 1818, when, after a grand review of the
united British, Danish, and Russian contingents at Valenciennes,
the SEVENTY-FIRST marched to Calais, and embarked for England.
Colonel Reynell continued in command of the regiment until the
12th of August 1819, the date of his promotion to the rank of
major-general.

In April 1820 Major-General Reynell was suddenly ordered to proceed
to Glasgow, having been appointed to the staff of North Britain
as a major-general, in which country he remained until March
1821, when, in consequence of the tranquillity of Scotland, the
extra general officer was discontinued. Immediately afterwards he
was appointed to the staff of the East Indies, and directed to
proceed to Bombay, for which presidency he embarked in September
following, and where he arrived in March 1822. After remaining
there a month, Major-General Reynell was removed to the staff of
the Bengal Presidency, by order of the Marquis of Hastings. In
August Major-General Reynell proceeded up the Ganges, and took the
command of the Meerut division on the 3d of December 1822.

The next operation of importance in which Major-General Reynell
was engaged was the siege of _Bhurtpore_. Early in December 1825
a large force had been assembled for this purpose, to the command
of which he had been appointed, when, just as the troops were
about to move into the Bhurtpore states, General Lord Combermere,
the new commander-in-chief in India, arrived from England, and
Major-General Reynell was then appointed to command the first
division of infantry. He commanded that division during the
siege, and directed the movements of the column of assault at the
north-east angle on the 18th of January 1826, when the place was
carried, and the citadel surrendered a few hours after. For this
service he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Bath, as well as
honored with the thanks of both Houses of Parliament.

Major-General Sir Thomas Reynell succeeded to the baronetcy upon
the decease of his brother Sir Richard Littleton Reynell in
September 1829; and on the 30th of January 1832 was appointed by
His Majesty King William IV. to be colonel of the ninety-ninth
regiment, from which he was removed to the eighty-seventh Royal
Irish fusiliers on the 15th of August 1834. On the 10th of January
1837, he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general, and on the
14th of June 1839 was appointed a member of the consolidated board
of general officers for the inspection and regulation of the
clothing of the army. On the 15th of March 1841, he was appointed
by Her Majesty to the colonelcy of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment.
The decease of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Reynell, Bart., K.C.B.,
occurred at Avisford, near Arundel, on the 10th of February 1848.


SIR THOMAS ARBUTHNOT, K.C.B.

_Appointed 18th February 1848._

This officer entered the army as ensign in the twenty-ninth
regiment on the 23d of November 1794, and was promoted lieutenant
in the fortieth regiment on the 1st of May 1796. He was advanced
to the rank of captain in the eighth West India regiment on the
25th of June 1798, and on the 26th of May 1803 was appointed
captain in the royal staff corps, and on the 7th of April 1808
was promoted major in the fifth West India regiment, in which
year he joined the staff of the army in the Peninsula, first
as assistant adjutant-general, and afterwards as assistant
quartermaster-general. Major Arbuthnot was present at the battles
of Roleia, Vimiera, and Corunna.

On the 24th of May 1810, he received the rank of lieutenant-colonel
in the army, and was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at
the Cape of Good Hope, where he arrived on the 25th March 1811.
Lieut.-Colonel Arbuthnot was appointed aide-de-camp to His Royal
Highness the Prince Regent on the 7th of February 1812, and in May
1813 proceeded from the Cape to the Peninsula, and was present
at the battles of the Pyrenees, Nivelle, and Orthes. For these
services in the Peninsula and south of France he was decorated
with a cross and one clasp. On the 24th of March 1814, Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Arbuthnot was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the
fifty-seventh regiment, and on the 4th of June following received
the brevet rank of colonel in the army. In January 1815 he was
nominated a Knight Commander of the Bath, and on the 12th of
August 1819 was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment. On the 27th of May 1825 he attained the rank of
major-general, and on the 15th of August 1836 was appointed colonel
of the ninety-ninth regiment. Sir Thomas Arbuthnot was advanced
to the rank of lieutenant-general on the 28th of June 1838, and
was removed to the fifty-second regiment on the 23d of December
1839. In August 1842 he was appointed to the command of the
northern and midland districts of Great Britain, which he retained
until his decease. On the 7th of December 1844 Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Arbuthnot was removed from the fifty-second to the ninth
foot, and on the 18th of February 1848 was appointed colonel of
the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment. Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B., died at Salford, near Manchester, on the 26th of January
1849.

APPENDIX.


_Memoir of Captain_ PHILIP MELVILL _of the_ SEVENTY-FIRST
_Regiment_.

Captain Philip Melvill was the fourth and youngest son of John
Melvill, Esq., of Dunbar, and was born on the 7th of April 1762. At
the age of sixteen he obtained a commission, on the 31st December
1777, as a lieutenant in the seventy-third now the SEVENTY-FIRST
regiment, commanded by Colonel John Lord Macleod, on condition
of raising a certain number of men, which, by the influence of
his relatives in the north of Scotland, he effected. Lieutenant
Melvill joined the regiment at Elgin, and was appointed to the
light company. In 1779 he embarked for India with his regiment,
and arrived at Madras in January 1780. His services now became
identical with those of Captain Baird, under whose command he
proceeded as part of a reinforcement to Lieut.-Colonel Baillie,
as detailed in the foregoing pages. In the action on the 10th
of September 1780, at Perambaukum, Lieutenant Melvill was
severely wounded in both arms; his left being broken, and, after
surrendering, the muscles of his right arm were cut in two by a
sabre. He was dashed unmercifully to the ground, and as he lay
exhausted, a horseman wounded him in the back with his spear. In
this miserable situation he continued for two days and two nights,
exposed to the intense heat of a burning sun, and to the danger
of being torn to pieces by beasts of prey. He was afterwards
conveyed to Hyder’s camp, and was confined at Bangalore with the
other prisoners. After three years and a half of confinement, they
obtained their release in March 1784.

Lieutenant Melvill had been advanced to the rank of captain on the
22d of June 1783; and being disabled from military duty by the
condition of his wounds, was, on being released from captivity,
enabled to visit his brother at Bengal, where he remained until
the beginning of the year 1786. Captain Melvill then returned
to England, when he was appointed, on the 3d of January 1787, to
the command of an invalid company stationed in Guernsey, where he
remained for five years. He subsequently exchanged into a company
at Portsmouth, and was afterwards placed on the retired list, in
consequence of ill-health. After remaining a year in retirement at
Topsham, in Devonshire, Captain Melvill, on the 29th of September
1796, exchanged his full pay as a retired captain for the command
of an invalid company stationed at Pendennis Castle in Cornwall.

In the year 1797, when preparations were made by France for
invading Great Britain, Captain Melvill, who had been appointed
lieut.-governor of Pendennis Castle, was mainly instrumental in
forming a corps of volunteers, which was subsequently retained,
first as the Pendennis Volunteer Artillery, and afterwards as a
body of local militia.

Lieut.-Governor Melvill died on the 27th October 1811, aged
forty-nine, and was interred in Falmouth Church.


_Memoir of the services of General the Right Honorable Sir David
Baird, Bart., G.C.B. & K.C., formerly Lieut.-Colonel of the_
SEVENTY-FIRST _Regiment_.

This celebrated commander commenced his military career as an
ensign in the second foot, his commission being dated the 14th of
December 1772. He joined the regiment at Gibraltar in April 1773,
and in 1775 returned with it to England. In February 1778 he was
promoted lieutenant in the second foot, and on the 16th of December
1777 was promoted to a company in the seventy third regiment, then
being raised by Colonel Lord Macleod, which was afterwards numbered
the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment. This corps Captain Baird joined at
Elgin, from whence he marched to Fort George, and embarked for
Guernsey. In January 1779 he embarked with his regiment for India,
and arrived at Madras in January 1780. The regiment, shortly
after its arrival in India, was called upon to take part in the
war against Hyder Ali, the powerful sovereign of the Mysore,
whose army exceeded eighty thousand, besides a strong body under
a general of the name of Meer Saib, who had entered the Company’s
territories on the north. This force was rendered still more
formidable and effective by the aid of Monsieur Lally’s troops,
and a great number of French officers who served his artillery,
and even directed all his marches and operations. The British army
ready to oppose this invasion did not consist of five thousand
men. These were commanded by Major-General Sir Hector Munro,
K.B., and were stationed at St. Thomas’s Mount, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Madras, in order to cover that city. Here they
were joined by Colonel Lord Macleod and the seventy-third regiment.

Hyder Ali, after a march across the country, which he marked by
fire and sword, suddenly turned upon Arcot, and on the 21st of
August 1780 sat down before that city, as the first operation
of the war. Arcot was the capital town of the territory of the
nabob of that name, the only prince in India who was friendly
and in alliance with the Company. It contained immense stores of
provisions, and, what was equally wanted, a vast treasure of money.
There was another important reason, which required on the part of
the British an immediate attention to this movement. Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie, with a body of troops, was in the Northern Circars; and
Hyder Ali, by besieging Arcot, had interposed himself between this
detachment and the main army under Major-General Sir Hector Munro.
Orders were immediately sent to Lieut.-Colonel Baillie to hasten
to the Mount, to join the main army; and Sir Hector Munro, at once
to meet Lieut.-Colonel Baillie and to raise the siege of Arcot,
marched on the 25th of August with his army for Conjeveram, a place
forty miles distant from Madras, in the Arcot road.

The British troops were followed during the whole way by the
enemy’s horse. They were four days on their march to Conjeveram,
and when they arrived, they found the whole country under water,
and no provisions of any kind to be procured. So relax were the
commissaries appointed by the Madras government, that the army had
but four days’ provisions; in the midst of the most fertile region
of India, and in the very onset and commencement of a war, the
troops were in danger of being famished. The army had no other
resource than to spread itself individually over the fields, and,
at the risk of being destroyed in detail by the enemy’s horse,
collect the growing rice, up to their knees in water.

Hyder Ali, as the British general foresaw, raised the siege of
Arcot upon this movement towards Conjeveram; but, what he had not
foreseen, his politic enemy threw his army in such a manner across
the only possible road of Lieut.-Colonel Baillie’s detachment, as
to prevent the desired junction, which had been expected to have
taken place on the 30th of August, the day after the arrival of
the army at Conjeveram. Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, before this last
movement of the enemy to cut him off, had been stopped for some
days, at no great distance, by the sudden rising of a small river.
Hyder made use of this time to throw his army between them. On the
5th of September Lieut.-Colonel Baillie effected his passage over
the river, but Hyder, being informed of it, made a second movement,
which completely intercepted him. In order in some degree, however,
to defeat this movement, but with slight hopes of success, Sir
Hector Munro changed his position likewise, and advanced about two
miles, to a high ground on the Tripassoor road, which was the way
that the expected detachment was to come. By these movements the
hostile camps were brought within two miles of each other, the
enemy lying about that distance to the left of the British.

Lieut.-Colonel Baillie had passed the river in his way on the
afternoon of the 5th of September, and encamped for the night.
Hyder, on receiving this information, made the movement before
related, and other arrangements on the following morning, the 6th
of September, and Sir Hector Munro changed his own position at
the same time. This change was scarcely effected when the evident
bustle in the enemy’s army explained its purpose. In fact the
purport of Hyder’s movement was to cover and support a great attack
at that moment making on Lieut.-Colonel Baillie’s detachment. He
had already sent his brother-in-law, Meer Saib, with eight thousand
horse upon that service, and immediately afterwards detached his
son, Tippoo Saib, with six thousand infantry, eighteen thousand
cavalry, and twelve pieces of cannon, to join in a united and
decisive attack. They encountered Lieut.-Colonel Baillie at
a place called Perambaukum, where he made the most masterly
dispositions to withstand this vast superiority of force. After
an exceedingly severe and well-fought action, of several hours’
continuance, the enemy was routed, and Lieut.-Colonel Baillie
gained as complete a victory as a total want of cavalry and the
smallness of his numbers could possibly admit. Through these
circumstances he lost his baggage. His whole force did not exceed
two thousand sepoys, and from one to two companies of European
artillery.

This success, however, by diminishing Lieut.-Colonel Baillie’s
force, only added to his distress. The British camp was within
a few miles, but Hyder’s army lay full in his way, and he was,
moreover, in the greatest want of provisions. Under these
circumstances, Lieut.-Colonel Baillie despatched a messenger to
Major-General Sir Hector Munro, with an account of his situation,
stating that he had sustained a loss which rendered him incapable
of advancing, while his total want of provisions rendered it
equally impossible for him to remain in his present position. A
council of war being held, at which Colonel Lord Macleod assisted,
it was resolved to send a reinforcement to Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie, to enable him to push forward in despite of the enemy.
Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher, Captain Baird, and other officers were
sent off with a strong detachment to the relief of Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie. The main force of this detachment consisted of the
flank companies of the first battalion of the _Seventy-third_,
afterwards numbered the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, the light company
being commanded by Captain Baird. There were two other companies
of European grenadiers, one company of sepoy marksmen, and ten
companies of sepoy grenadiers. In all about a thousand men. The
junction was effected with some difficulty on the 9th of September,
and the following day was appointed for the march of the united
detachment. Accordingly, day-light had scarcely broken when it
commenced its march. By seven o’clock in the morning of the 10th of
September the enemy poured down upon them in thousands. The British
fought with the greatest heroism, and at one time victory seemed
to be in their favour. But the tumbrils containing the ammunition
accidentally blew up with two dreadful explosions in the centre of
their lines. The destruction of men was great, but the total loss
of their ammunition was still more fatal to the survivors. This
turned the fortune of the day, and after successive prodigies of
valour the brave sepoys were almost to a man cut to pieces.

Lieut.-Colonels Baillie and Fletcher, assisted by Captain Baird,
made one more desperate effort. They rallied the Europeans, and,
under the fire of the whole of the immense artillery of the enemy,
gained a little eminence, and formed themselves into a fresh
square. In this form did this invincible band, though totally
without ammunition, the officers fighting with their swords and the
soldiers with their bayonets, resist and repulse the myriads of the
enemy in thirteen different attacks, until at length, incapable of
withstanding the successive torrents of fresh troops which were
continually pouring upon them, they were fairly borne down and
trampled on, many of them still continuing to fight under the legs
of the horses and elephants.

The loss of the British in the action at Perambaukum was of
course great; and it is a reasonable subject of surprise that
any escaped. Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher was amongst the slain.
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, Captain Baird, after being severely
wounded in four places, together with Captain the Honorable John
Lindsay, Lieutenant Philip Melvill, and other officers, with two
hundred Europeans, were made prisoners. They were carried into the
presence of Hyder, who, with a true Asiatic barbarism, received
them with the most insolent triumph and ferocious pride. The
British officers, with a spirit worthy of their country, retorted
his pride by an indignant coolness and contempt. “Your son will
inform you,” said Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, appealing to Tippoo, who
was present, “that you owe the victory to our disaster rather than
to our defeat.” Hyder angrily ordered them from his presence, and
commanded them instantly to prison, where they remained for three
years and a half, enduring great hardships, Captain Baird being
chained by the leg to another prisoner.

In March 1784 Captain Baird was released, and in July joined his
regiment at Arcot. In 1786 the _Seventy-third_ was directed to be
numbered the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment. Captain Baird was promoted
to the rank of major in the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment on the 5th
of June 1787, and in October obtained leave of absence, when he
returned to Great Britain. He was advanced to the lieut.-colonelcy
of the regiment on the 8th of December 1790, and in 1791 proceeded
to India, and joined the army under General the Earl Cornwallis.
Lieut.-Colonel Baird commanded a brigade of sepoys, and was present
at the attack of a number of droogs or hill forts; also at the
siege of Seringapatam in 1791 and 1792; likewise at the storming
of Tippoo’s lines and camps on the island of Seringapatam. In
1793 the Lieut.-Colonel commanded a brigade of Europeans, and was
present at the siege of Pondicherry. On the 21st of August 1795,
he was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel, and in October
1797 embarked at Madras with the SEVENTY-FIRST for Europe, but on
arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, in January following, he was
appointed brigadier-general, and placed on that staff in command of
a brigade. He was promoted to the rank of major-general on the 18th
of June 1798, and was removed to the staff in India. Major-General
Baird sailed from the Cape of Good Hope for Madras in command of
two regiments of infantry and the drafts of the twenty-eighth
dragoons, and arrived at his destination in January 1799. On the
1st of February he joined the army forming at Vellore for the
attack of Seringapatam, and commanded a brigade of Europeans. On
the 4th of May Major-General Baird commanded the storming party
with success, and, in consequence, was presented by the army,
through Lieut.-General, afterwards Lord Harris, Commander-in-Chief,
with Tippoo Sultan’s state sword, and a dress sword from the
field officers serving under his immediate command. In 1800 he
was removed to the Bengal staff, and on the 9th of May of that
year was appointed colonel-commandant of the fifty-fourth, and
colonel of that regiment on the 8th of May 1801, in which year he
was appointed to command the forces which were sent from India
to Egypt, and arrived at Cosseir in June, afterwards crossed the
desert, and embarked on the Nile, arriving in the following month
at Grand Cairo. He joined the army under Lieut.-General Sir John
Hutchinson, afterwards the Earl of Donoughmore, a few days before
the surrender of Alexandria, which capitulated on the 2d of
September, and terminated the campaign in Egypt.

In 1802 Major-General Baird returned across the desert to India,
and was removed to the Madras staff in 1803, and commanded a large
division of the army forming against the Mahrattas. He marched into
the Mysore country, where the Commander-in-Chief, Lieut.-General
James Stuart, joined him, and afterwards arrived on the banks
of the river Jambudra, in command of the line. Major-General
Wellesley, the present Duke of Wellington, being appointed to
the command of the greater part of the army, Major-General Baird
proceeded into the Mahratta country, and subsequently obtained
permission to return to Great Britain. He sailed in March with his
staff from Madras, and was taken prisoner by a French privateer.
In October he was re-taken as the ship was entering Corunna. He
arrived in England on the 3d of November, having given his parole
that he should consider himself as a prisoner of war; but shortly
after Major-General Baird and staff were exchanged for the French
General Morgan and his staff.

Major-General Sir David Baird, who had received the honour of
knighthood, was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general on the 30th
of October 1805, and commanded an expedition against the Cape
of Good Hope, where he arrived on the 5th of January 1806, and
effected a landing on the following day. On the 8th, the Dutch
army was defeated; on the 10th, the castle and town of Cape Town
surrendered; and on the 18th, General Janssens surrendered the
colony. In 1807 Lieut.-General Sir David Baird returned to England,
and on the 19th of July of that year was removed from the colonelcy
of the fifty-fourth to that of the twenty-fourth regiment. His next
service was in the expedition to Copenhagen under Lieut.-General
Lord Cathcart, at the siege of which he commanded a division,
and was twice slightly wounded. In 1808 Lieut.-General Sir David
Baird was placed on the staff in Ireland, and commanded the camp
on the Curragh of Kildare. In September of that year he embarked
at the Cove of Cork, in the command of a division, consisting of
about five thousand infantry, for Falmouth, where he received
reinforcements, and sailed in command of about ten thousand men
for Corunna, where he arrived in the beginning of November, and
formed a junction with the army under Lieut.-General Sir John
Moore. Lieut.-General Sir David Baird commanded the first division
of that army, and in the battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January
1809, he lost his left arm. Sir David Baird received the thanks of
both Houses of Parliament for his services at Corunna; “an honor
of which,” he remarked in his reply to the House of Peers, “no one
can be more fully sensible than myself, having had the good fortune
to be deemed worthy of this eminent distinction on four several
occasions;” alluding to his name having been included in the votes
of thanks for the operations of the army in India in 1799, for
those of Egypt in 1801, and in the Danish expedition in 1807.

In testimony of the Royal approbation, Lieut.-General Sir David
Baird was created a baronet, by patent dated 13th April 1809, and
was promoted to the rank of general on the 4th of June 1814; on the
2d of January 1815 he was nominated a Knight Grand Cross of the
Order of the Bath, and was appointed governor of Kinsale on the
11th of March 1819, and of Fort George, North Britain, on the 4th
of December 1827. He was also a privy councillor for Ireland. His
decease occurred at his seat, Ferntower, in Perthshire, on the 18th
of August 1829.


_Memoir of the services of Major-General Sir Denis Pack, K.C.B. and
C.T.S., formerly Lieut.-Colonel of the_ SEVENTY-FIRST _regiment_.

This distinguished officer entered the army as a cornet in the
fourteenth light dragoons, his commission being dated 30th November
1791, and joined that regiment in Dublin in January 1792. He
served in Ireland, and was engaged in quelling some disturbances,
between that period and 1794, when he embarked at Cork for the
Continent, and landed with the forces under Lieut.-General the
Earl of Moira at Ostend. After his lordship’s march from thence
to form a junction with the army under His Royal Highness the
Duke of York, Cornet Pack offered his services and was employed
to carry an important despatch to Nieuport, in which attempt he
fortunately succeeded, and was thanked for it by Major-General
Richard Vyse. His commanding officer’s squadron of the fourteenth
light dragoons was destined, after the embarkation at Ostend, to
retreat to Nieuport, which it effected by the advance of a corps
from that place to its support. Nieuport being almost immediately
invested, farther retreat from thence became extremely hazardous
and difficult. Cornet Pack was in a boat with about two hundred
emigrants, and did not gain the sea without a sharp action and a
severe loss. It conveyed the last of those who escaped the horrors
which befell that ill-fated garrison. He joined the Duke of York’s
army near Antwerp, and was in the action at Boxtel, and some
partial affairs. He served that severe winter campaign, and in
1795 returned to England, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in the
fourteenth light dragoons on the 12th of March of that year.

Lieutenant Pack subsequently embarked at Southampton in command
of a detachment of eighty dragoons destined for Quiberon Bay.
After the failure of the emigrants there, he proceeded under the
orders of Major-General Welbore Ellis Doyle to the Isle de Dieu,
where he landed, and did duty for some months as field officer.
In 1796, Lieutenant Pack returned to England, and on the 27th
February of that year was promoted to the rank of captain in the
fifth dragoon guards, which regiment he accompanied to Ireland, and
was frequently engaged during the rebellion in that country, and
was noticed in a despatch dated 21st of June 1798, from General
the Marquis Cornwallis, K.G., on the occasion of Captain Pack’s
detachment defeating a party of rebels, on the 19th of that month,
between Rathangan and Prosperous.

When the French landed a force in that country, Captain Pack was
specially employed by General the Marquis Cornwallis, with a
detached squadron, and after the surrender of General Humbert he
was appointed to command the escort which was despatched in charge
of him and the other French generals to Dublin.

On the 25th of August 1798 Captain Pack was advanced to the rank of
major in the fourth royal Irish dragoon guards, and embarked with
his regiment in the expedition to Holland, but was countermanded,
and stationed in England and Scotland until 1800, when he was
promoted, on the 6th of December of that year, to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel in the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment, and on the 24th
of April 1801 joined that corps in Ireland, in which country he
served until August 1805, when he embarked at Cork with the first
battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST regiment in the expedition to the
Cape of Good Hope under Major-General Sir David Baird, and was
engaged and severely wounded in effecting the landing at the Cape
on the 6th of January 1806, but continued in the field, and was,
on the 8th of January, in the action at Bleuberg. These operations
led to a treaty, which was signed on the 19th of the same month, by
which the Cape of Good Hope was surrendered to Great Britain.

In April 1806 Lieut.-Colonel Pack proceeded, with the first
battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST, in the expedition to South America
under the command of Brigadier-General William Carr Beresford,
afterwards General Viscount Beresford, and was present in six
actions with the enemy in that country, and was wounded, and
detained a prisoner, contrary to the capitulation which restored
the town of Buenos Ayres to the Spaniards. Lieut.-Colonel Pack
subsequently effected his escape with Brigadier-General Beresford,
and joined the army at Monte Video, under Brigadier-General Sir
Samuel Auchmuty, who, at the request of Lieut.-Colonel Pack,
directed a board of naval and military officers to inquire into the
particulars of his escape, by whom it was unanimously approved,
and he was declared free to serve.[34] Lieut.-Colonel Pack was
then detached with a small force to Colonia, where he commanded
successfully in two actions; namely, in an attack on the enemy
on his post, and in one made on his, at St. Pedro, when, after
a forced night march, the troops under his orders, amounting to
1,013 rank and file, routed the enemy, on the 7th of June 1807, and
captured a standard, together with 105 prisoners, including one
lieut.-colonel and five other officers; all his artillery, baggage,
&c. were likewise taken.

Lieut.-Colonel Pack was shortly afterwards appointed by
Lieut.-General John Whitelocke to the command of all the light
companies in his army, and joined the force then in the River
Plate destined to act against Buenos Ayres. He was engaged in
two successful actions with the enemy prior to the unfortunate
attack on the town, in which he was three times wounded. Towards
the end of 1807 he returned to Europe, and early in 1808 had the
SEVENTY-FIRST completely re-equipped; and, proceeding with the
first battalion of the regiment from Cork to Portugal, on the 17th
of June following, in the expedition under Lieut.-General Sir
Arthur Wellesley, was present in the battles of Roleia and Vimiera,
on the 17th and 21st of August 1808, which rescued Portugal from
the French. The conduct of the battalion and of Lieut.-Colonel Pack
was noticed in the public despatches, and the troops received the
thanks of both Houses of Parliament.

Lieut.-Colonel Pack afterwards marched into Spain, under
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, and was at the affair of Lugo on
the 5th of January 1809, and at the battle of Corunna on the 16th
of that month, after which he returned to England, and embarked
in July following for Holland, under Lieut.-General the Earl
of Chatham. On landing at Walcheren, Lieut.-Colonel Pack was
appointed to command a small corps of cavalry and light infantry;
was employed in the siege of Flushing, and particularly named by
Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote for the command of a detachment to
storm an advanced work on the right of the enemy’s line. These
orders were successfully executed, the detachment taking forty-nine
prisoners, and spiking the guns, though defended by five times
the number of men under Lieut.-Colonel Pack. After the surrender
of Flushing he was appointed commandant of Ter Veer, where he was
dangerously ill for a short period, but remained until the island
was evacuated, on which occasion, in conjunction with Commodore
Owen, he commanded the rear-guard of the army.

Soon after the return of the SEVENTY-FIRST to England, in December
1809, the battalion was prepared again for active service; but the
government did not consider the men had sufficiently recovered from
the effects of the Walcheren fever.

Lieut.-Colonel Pack, being extremely anxious to bear a part in the
momentous campaign about to commence in the Peninsula, obtained His
Majesty’s permission to proceed to Portugal, and offer his services
to Viscount Wellington and Marshal Beresford. Both generals having
decided that he could not be more usefully employed than with the
Portuguese troops, he accepted an infantry brigade in that service,
and took the command of it just before the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo
by Marshal Massena, previously to his invasion of Portugal.

On the 25th of July 1810 Lieut.-Colonel Pack was appointed
aide-de-camp to the king, with the rank of colonel in the
army. After the surrender of Ciudad Rodrigo, of Almeida, and
Marshal Massena’s passage of the Coa, Colonel Pack’s brigade (an
independent one) was directed to take a separate route with a
regiment of cavalry attached to it, and remained in presence of the
enemy’s army at St. Combadoa, retiring slowly before it, on his
advance to the position at Busaco. The conduct of the brigade was
noticed in that battle, which was fought on the 27th of September
1810. In the admirable retreat afterwards to the lines of Lisbon,
it formed, with the light division and cavalry, the rear-guard of
the allied army. The first battalion of the SEVENTY-FIRST having
at that period joined Viscount Wellington, Colonel Pack’s wish
was to have returned to the battalion, but by the desire of both
commanders-in-chief, he continued to serve in the Portuguese army.

In 1811 the brigade was in the advance guard in following the enemy
up to his position at Santarem; was at the out-posts there, and
again in the advance on the further retreat of the French from
Portugal. It was employed in the investment of Almeida, and in the
operations against Marshal Marmont, on his advance to the relief
of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812. At the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo
it bore a distinguished part. It marched to the siege of Badajos,
and was in active operations against the enemy on his advance to
the Tagus, and subsequent retreat from Portugal. It moved in the
advanced guard on the march of the allies to Salamanca and the
Douro. It suffered severely in the battle of Salamanca on the 22d
of July 1812.

The brigade was in the march to and capture of Madrid; in the march
to Burgos, and subsequent siege of that place. Previously to the
siege of Burgos, detachments under Colonel Pack’s command carried
by assault the horn-work of that castle, after a desperate and
gallant action, for which the special thanks of His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent, and the Commander-in-Chief, were given to the
troops, through the Marquis of Wellington. In the retreat from
Burgos, which commenced in October 1812, the brigade under Colonel
Pack formed the rear-guard, and from thence to the frontier of
Portugal was very frequently in presence of the enemy.

In the memorable advance of the Marquis of Wellington into Spain,
in May 1813, and the passage of the Ebro, the brigade was in the
advanced guard of the left column of the army under Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Graham, afterwards Lord Lynedoch. It was in the battle
of Vittoria, fought on the 21st of June 1813, and again in the
advance of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham’s corps, in the pursuit
of the French to the Bidassoa. Shortly afterwards, Major-General
Pack, to which rank he was advanced on the 4th of June 1813,
was appointed to the _Highland_ brigade in the sixth division;
the division at this time for a short period was also under his
command, and after a forced march he arrived in time to share in
the victory gained by the Marquis of Wellington over the French
under Marshal Soult near Pampeluna, on the 30th of July 1813, in
which action Major-General Pack was severely wounded in the head.
He commanded the Highland brigade in the passage of the Bidassoa,
and advance of the British into France; in the overthrow of the
enemy in his fortified lines before Bayonne; the advance to and
passage of the Nive; the repulse of the enemy’s attack on the
British position before St. Jean de Luz; and, though not actually
engaged, he was present at the signal defeat of the enemy’s
desperate attack on Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s corps on the
13th of December 1813. Major-General Pack was also in the passage
of the Bidassoa, the Gave D’Oleron, and the Pau; at the battle of
Orthes on the 27th of February 1814; in the passage of the Adour
at St. Seur, and at the battle of Toulouse on the 10th of April
following, in which his brigade had nearly two-thirds of the
officers and upwards of half the privates killed and wounded. Louis
XVIII. was shortly afterwards restored to the throne of France,
Napoleon retired to the island of Elba, and the Peninsular war
terminated.

In 1813 Major-General Pack had been appointed a Knight Commander
of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword, and on the 2d of
January 1815 was nominated a Knight Commander of the Order of
the Bath. He received a cross and seven clasps for the following
actions, at all of which he commanded troops, and was personally
engaged: Roleia, Vimiera, Corunna, Busaco, siege of Ciudad Rodrigo,
Salamanca, Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse.
Sir Denis Pack had received eight wounds, six of them rather severe
ones; had been frequently struck by shot, and had several horses
killed and wounded under him.

In March 1815 Europe was astounded by the return of Napoleon
to Paris. The allied powers, however, refused to recognize his
sovereignty, and determined on his dethronement. A large army
proceeded to Flanders under Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington,
and Major-General Sir Denis Pack was placed in command of a
brigade. The campaign was as brief as it was glorious. On the 16th
of June, Napoleon, after having made one of his rapid movements,
attacked the Anglo-Belgian troops at Quatre Bras, in which the
fifth division under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Picton, of which
Major-General Sir Denis Pack’s brigade formed part, was engaged.
Then followed the movement on the 17th to Waterloo, where, on the
18th of June, was fought that memorable battle in which the sun
of Napoleon set for ever, and the result of which gave to Europe
a lengthened period of tranquillity. These arduous conflicts
afforded Major-General Sir Denis Pack several opportunities for
distinguishing himself, and adding to his former honors.

Sir Denis Pack had the honor to receive the thanks of both Houses
of Parliament on six different occasions; namely, for his conduct
in the battles of Roleia and Vimiera; for the siege of Ciudad
Rodrigo; and for the battles of Salamanca, Vittoria, Orthes, and
Waterloo.

On the 8th of January 1816 Major-General Sir Denis Pack was
appointed colonel of the York chasseurs, which corps was
subsequently disbanded. On the 12th of August 1819 he was appointed
lieut.-governor of Plymouth, and to the command of the troops in
the western district, and on the 9th of September 1822 he was
appointed colonel of the eighty-fourth regiment. The decease of
Major-General Sir Denis Pack occurred on the 24th of July 1823,
at which period he held the command of the troops in the western
district of Great Britain, and the lieut.-governorship of Plymouth.


The following letter to Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty
contains a full and satisfactory explanation of the motives by
which Lieut.-Colonel Pack was actuated in effecting his escape, as
alluded to in the foregoing memoir.

  “Monte Video, 27th February 1807.

  “SIR,

  “Anxious to be immediately employed in the service of my country,
  I take the liberty of stating the circumstances which led me
  to make my escape from the enemy, trusting my conduct on the
  occasion will meet with your sanction, and that you will be
  pleased to take my wishes into consideration.

  “The following, I believe, will be found a correct statement of
  the transaction.

  “Immediately after the surrender of the fort of Buenos Ayres,
  on the 12th of August last, I understood from Brigadier-General
  Beresford that the conditions verbally agreed to between him
  and Colonel Liniers were, that the British troops were to be
  considered as prisoners of war, but to be immediately embarked
  for England or the Cape and to be exchanged for those Spanish
  prisoners made on the British possessing themselves of Buenos
  Ayres. On the 13th, in the morning, Colonel Liniers despatched a
  Spanish officer to Sir Home Popham, with a letter from General
  Beresford, to send the British transports back for the purpose
  of immediately carrying the treaty into execution, and a few
  days afterwards I was present when Colonel Liniers unequivocally
  affixed his name to the capitulation containing the above
  condition.

  “After the return of the transports, various delays took
  place; and, I believe, it was on the 26th that Colonel Liniers
  informed General Beresford, in presence of Major Tolly of the
  SEVENTY-FIRST regiment and Captain Arbuthnot, the general’s
  aide-de-camp, (from all of whom I learned it,) that he regretted
  to inform him of its having been resolved, in spite of his
  efforts, not to embark the British troops, and at the same time,
  declaring _his_ (_Colonel Liniers’_) abhorrence of such a breach
  of faith, and offering to second General Beresford’s remonstrance
  on the occasion. On the 27th, in the evening, I heard that
  Colonel Liniers’ aide-de-camp had waited on General Beresford,
  stating it to be the colonel’s intention to carry the treaty into
  execution by privately embarking the men, and requesting the
  general would, for that purpose, order the British transports to
  a particular place.

  “However, on the 31st of August or the 1st of September, it was
  finally announced to General Beresford, in a letter printed and
  made public, that our surrender was at discretion, and that it
  was the determination of the then government of Buenos Ayres
  that the British troops should be sent to the interior, and the
  officers, on their parole, to Europe.

  “General Beresford, for obvious reasons, at first declined our
  passing a parole; but being given to understand that without it
  our persons were insecure, and it being determined to separate
  the officers from the men, he (with the concurrence of the
  majority of the seniors) finally acceded to it.

  “Notwithstanding this, on the appearance of a British force in
  the river, they were suddenly compelled to march, under an armed
  escort, several miles into the interior, and about two months
  afterwards orders were given to separate and remove them still
  farther, and which, (notwithstanding the remonstrances of the
  brigadier-general) were carried into effect. In his communication
  at that time with Colonel Liniers, he fully explained that we did
  not consider ourselves on parole, nor did we think it binding,
  after our removal in the first instance, and their refusing to
  fulfil the conditions under which we had been prevailed upon to
  give it.

  “About this time the unfortunate murder of Captain Ogilvie of
  the Royal Artillery and a private soldier of the SEVENTY-FIRST
  regiment took place, when guards were placed at some of
  the quarters of the officers, professedly for the purpose
  of protection, but positively with strict injunctions most
  narrowly to watch us, and to take care (as the government said
  in their instructions to the alcalde on the same subject) that
  we did not desert. I mention this circumstance to prove there
  could be no misunderstanding on the subject; for though such
  language must be considered unhandsome and illiberal under any
  circumstances, it surely never could have been held to officers
  on their parole. On the arrival of the news of the capture
  of Monte Video by our forces, the chief magistrate of Buenos
  Ayres repaired to General Beresford’s quarters, accompanied by
  Lieut.-Col. Garcias, acquainting him with the necessity there
  was of possessing himself with the papers of the several British
  officers, prisoners, which he proceeded to do, _placing sentry
  over them individually_ until he effected his purpose; and in
  a conversation which General Beresford had with Lieut.-Colonel
  Garcias, he expressly told him that we were not on our parole,
  recapitulating the explanation made to Colonel Liniers upon the
  subject.

  “Shortly after this the necessity of moving nine hundred miles
  farther into the interior was communicated to us, and we were on
  our journey with an armed escort, when an opportunity offered,
  of which I most gladly availed myself, to make my escape. I will
  not further trespass on your time by commenting on the many
  circumstances I conceive so evidently conclusive, but submit
  the bare facts to your better judgment. However, I cannot debar
  myself the satisfaction of acknowledging here the obligation I am
  under to many individuals, and the kind and generous treatment
  which I myself, as well as the British officers in general,
  received from the inhabitants of the town and country of Buenos
  Ayres.

  “I have the honor to be,
  “Sir,

  “GENERAL ORDERS.

  “_His Majesty’s Ship, “Audacious,_”
  “_18th January_ 1809.

  “The irreparable loss that has been sustained by the fall of the
  Commander of the Forces (Lieut.-General Sir John Moore), and the
  severe wound which has removed Lieut.-General Sir David Baird
  from his station, render it the duty of Lieut.-General Hope to
  congratulate the army upon the successful result of the action of
  the 16th instant.

  “On no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever
  been more manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing
  march, rendered necessary by the superiority which the enemy had
  acquired, and which had materially impaired the efficiency of the
  troops, many disadvantages were to be encountered.

  “These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the troops
  themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that whatever
  advantages of position or of numbers he may employ, there is
  inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that
  knows not how to yield, that no circumstances can appal, and that
  will ensure victory when it is to be obtained by the exertion of
  any human means.

  “The Lieut.-General has the greatest satisfaction in
  distinguishing such meritorious services as came within his
  observation, or have been brought to his knowledge.

  “His acknowledgments are, in a peculiar manner, due to
  Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, and the brigade under his
  command, consisting of the fourth, forty-second, and fiftieth
  regiments, and which sustained the weight of the attack.

  “Major-General Manningham, with his brigade, consisting of
  the Royals, the twenty-sixth and eighty-first regiments, and
  Major-General Warde, with the brigade of Guards, will also be
  pleased to accept his best thanks for their steady and gallant
  conduct during the action.

  “To Major-General Paget, who, by a judicious movement of the
  reserve, effectually contributed to check the progress of
  the enemy on the right; and to the first battalion of the
  fifty-second and ninety-fifth regiments, which were thereby
  engaged, the greatest praise is justly due.

  “That part of Major General Leith’s brigade which was engaged,
  consisting of the fifty-ninth regiment, under the conduct of the
  Major-General, also claims marked approbation.

  “The enemy not having rendered the attack on the left a serious
  one, did not afford to the troops stationed in that quarter an
  opportunity of displaying that gallantry which must have made him
  repent the attempt.

  “The piquets and advanced posts, however, of the brigades under
  the command of Major-Generals Hill and Leith, and Colonel Catlin
  Craufurd, conducted themselves with determined resolution, and
  were ably supported by the officers commanding these brigades,
  and by the troops of which they were composed.

  “It is peculiarly incumbent upon the Lieut.-General to notice the
  vigorous attack made by the second battalion of the fourteenth
  regiment under Lieut.-Colonel Nicolls, which drove the enemy out
  of the village, of the left of which he had possessed himself.

  “The exertions of Lieut.-Colonel Murray, Quartermaster-General,
  and of the other officers of the General Staff, during the
  action, were unremitted, and deserve every degree of approbation.

  “The illness of Brigadier-General Clinton, Adjutant-General,
  unfortunately deprived the army of the benefit of his services.

  “The Lieut.-General hopes the loss in point of numbers is not so
  considerable as might have been expected; he laments, however,
  the fall of the gallant soldiers and valuable officers who have
  suffered.

  “The Lieut.-General knows that it is impossible, in any language
  he can use, to enhance the esteem, or diminish the regret, that
  the army feels with him for its late Commander. His career has
  been unfortunately too limited for his country, but has been
  sufficient for his own fame. Beloved by the army, honored by his
  Sovereign, and respected by his country, he has terminated a life
  devoted to her service by a glorious death,--leaving his name as
  a memorial, an example, and an incitement to those who shall
  follow him in the path of honor, and it is from his country alone
  that his memory can receive the tribute which is its due.

  (Signed)       “JOHN HOPE, Lieut.-General.”


  “GENERAL ORDERS.

  “_Horse Guards, 1st February 1809._

  “The benefits derived to an army from the example of a
  distinguished Commander do not terminate at his death; his
  virtues live in the recollection of his associates, and his fame
  remains the strongest incentive to great and glorious actions.

  “In this view the Commander-in-Chief, amidst the deep and
  universal regret which the death of Lieut.-General Sir John Moore
  has occasioned, recals to the troops the military career of that
  illustrious officer for their instruction and imitation.

  “Sir John Moore from his youth embraced the profession with the
  feelings and sentiments of a soldier; he felt that a perfect
  knowledge and an exact performance of the humble but important
  duties of a subaltern officer are the best foundations for
  subsequent military fame, and his ardent mind, while it looked
  forward to those brilliant achievements for which it was formed,
  applied itself with energy and exemplary assiduity to the duties
  of that station.

  “In the school of regimental duty he obtained that correct
  knowledge of his profession so essential to the proper direction
  of the gallant spirit of the soldier, and he was enabled to
  establish a characteristic order and regularity of conduct,
  because the troops found in their leader a striking example of
  the discipline which he enforced on others.

  “Having risen to command, he signalised his name in the West
  Indies, in Holland, and in Egypt. The unremitting attention with
  which he devoted himself to the duties of every branch of his
  profession obtained him the confidence of Sir Ralph Abercromby,
  and he became the companion in arms of that illustrious officer,
  who fell at the head of his victorious troops in an action which
  maintained our national superiority over the arms of France.

  “Thus Sir John Moore at an early period obtained, with general
  approbation, that conspicuous station in which he gloriously
  terminated his useful and honorable life.

  “In a military character obtained amidst the dangers of climate,
  the privations incident to service, and the sufferings of
  repeated wounds, it is difficult to select any one point as a
  preferable subject for praise; it exhibits, however, one feature
  so particularly characteristic of the man, and so important to
  the best interests of the service, that the Commander-in-Chief is
  pleased to mark it with his peculiar approbation--

  “THE LIFE OF SIR JOHN MOORE WAS SPENT AMONG THE TROOPS.

  “During the season of repose his time was devoted to the care
  and instruction of the officer and soldier; in war he courted
  service in every quarter of the globe. Regardless of personal
  consideration, he esteemed that to which his country called
  him _the post of honor_, and by his undaunted spirit and
  unconquerable perseverance he pointed the way to victory.

  “His country, the object of his latest solicitude, will rear a
  monument to his lamented memory, and the Commander-in-Chief feels
  he is paying the best tribute to his fame by thus holding him
  forth as an EXAMPLE to the ARMY.

  “By order of His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief,

  “HARRY CALVERT, _Adjutant-General_.”

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
