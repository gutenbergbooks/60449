<h2 class="p4 no-brk lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright examples
to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and
thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct
of those who have preceded him in their honorable
career, are among the motives that have given rise
to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting
under their orders, expressions of approbation and
of thanks for their skill and bravery; and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their
Sovereign’s approbation, constitute the reward
which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the Official Reports made by the respective
Commanders, ample justice has generally been done
to the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General’s Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse:
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was; the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers; half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of
companies into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men; but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of Pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted
about twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery
was first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War.
Since that period the arms of the infantry soldier
have been limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops
have seldom differed materially, since the Conquest,
from those of other European states; and in some
respects the arming has, at certain periods, been
allowed to be inferior to that of the nations with
whom they have had to contend; yet, under this
disadvantage, the bravery and superiority of the
British infantry have been evinced on very many
and most trying occasions, and splendid victories
have been gained over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a rate of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to ensure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have
the welfare of their country at heart, the records
of the several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<p>
In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the successful
result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January 1809,
it is stated:&mdash;“On no occasion has the undaunted valour of British
troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a severe and
harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority which the enemy
had acquired, and which had materially impaired the efficiency of the
troops, many disadvantages were to be encountered. These have all
been surmounted by the conduct of the troops themselves: and the
enemy has been taught, that whatever advantages of position or of
numbers he may possess, there is inherent in the British officers and
soldiers a bravery that knows not how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances
can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure victory, when it is to be obtained by
the exertion of any human means.”</p></div></div>

<p>The 71st, 72d, 73d, 74th, and 75th regiments, thus

Fontainebleau.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>2. Several other corps were likewise disbanded in
1763, which occasioned a change in the numerical
titles of the following regiments of Invalids, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The 71st, 72d, 73d, 74th, and 75th regiments, thus
numbered, were formed into independent companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvq" id="Page_xvq">[xv]</a></span>
of Invalids in the year 1769, which increased the
number of <em>Invalid companies</em> from eight to twenty;
they were appropriated to the following Garrisons,
namely, four companies at Guernsey, four at Jersey,
three at Hull, two at Chester, two at Tilbury Fort,
two at Sheerness, one at Landguard Fort, one at
Pendennis, and one in the Scilly Islands.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>3. These numerical titles became thus extinct until
October 1775, when another <span class="fs70">SEVENTY-FIRST</span> regiment
was raised for service in America by Major-General
the Honorable Simon Fraser, which consisted of two
battalions, and which performed eminent service
during the war with the colonists. In December
1777, further augmentations were made to the army,
and the regiments, which were directed to be raised,
were numbered from the seventy-second to the eighty-third
regiment.</p>

<p>The army was subsequently increased to one hundred
and five regular regiments of infantry, exclusive
of eleven unnumbered regiments, and thirty-six independent
companies of Invalids.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the general peace in 1783
occasioned the disbandment of several regiments,
commencing with the <span class="fs70">SEVENTY-FIRST</span> regiment; the
second battalion of which was disbanded on the 5th
April 1783, and the first battalion on the 4th June
1784.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>4. In 1786 the numerical titles of certain regiments,
retained on the reduced establishment of the army,
were changed, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <em>seventy-third</em>, which had been authorised to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviq" id="Page_xviq">[xvi]</a></span>
raised by John Lord Macleod in 1777, was directed
to be numbered the <span class="fs70">SEVENTY-FIRST</span> regiment.</p>

<p>The <em>seventy-eighth</em>, which had been authorised
to be raised by the Earl of Seaforth in 1777, was
directed to be numbered the <span class="fs70">SEVENTY-SECOND</span> regiment.</p>

<p>The <em>second battalion</em> of the <em>forty-second</em>, which had
been authorised to be raised in 1779, was directed to
be constituted the <span class="fs70">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment.</p>

<p>These corps were denominated Highland regiments,
and have since continued to form part of the
regular army.</p>

regiment are contained in the following pages;

<p>The war between Great Britain and her American
Colonies had, towards the end of the year 1777, assumed
an aspect which was beheld with great interest by the
European powers. France, although abstaining at this
period from entering into the contest, privately encouraged
the colonists, and several French officers proceeded
to join the American standard. The influence of the
British ministry then became employed in encouraging
voluntary efforts for the raising of troops. Liverpool,
Manchester, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, at their own
expense, each raised a regiment of a thousand men,
and several independent companies were levied in
Wales. The livery of London and corporation of
Bristol did not follow this example, but the monied
interest in the metropolis showed its attachment to the
administration by opening a subscription for procuring
soldiers.</p>

<p>Fifteen thousand men were by these patriotic efforts
raised and presented to the state; of this number upwards
of two thirds were obtained from Scotland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
principally from the <em>Highland</em> clans.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The hardy
mountaineers of North Britain had been long celebrated
for their military prowess, and the annals of
warfare of subsequent years have added to their former
renown, by affording them opportunities for sustaining
their character for intrepidity and valour.</p>

<p>The present <span class="smcap">Seventy-first, Highland Light
Infantry</span>, was one of the regiments which owes its
origin to the foregoing circumstances, and was raised
under the following royal warrant, dated 19th December
1777, addressed to John Mackenzie, Esquire, commonly
called John Lord Macleod, who was appointed
its colonel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">George R.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> we have thought fit to order a Highland
regiment of foot to be forthwith raised under
your command, to consist of ten companies, of five
serjeants, five corporals, two drummers, and one hundred
private men in each, with two pipers to the
grenadier company, besides commissioned officers,
these are to authorise you, by beat of drum or otherwise,
to raise so many men in any county or part of
our kingdom of Great Britain as shall be wanting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

<p class="p1" />
<div class="sidenote">1778.</div>

<p>In February 1778 the Court of France concluded
a treaty of defensive alliance with the American colonies,
and Great Britain became involved in a war with
France.</p>

<p>Lord Macleod’s efforts in raising the regiment were so
successful that in April 1778 it was embodied at Elgin,
under the denomination of “<em>Macleod’s Highlanders</em>,”
and was numbered the “<span class="smcap">Seventy-third Regiment</span>.”</p>

<p>In May the regiment, eleven hundred strong, embarked
at Fort George, under the command of Colonel
Lord Macleod, and proceeded to Guernsey and Jersey,
in which islands it was stationed for six months. The
regiment was subsequently removed to Portsmouth,
and was cantoned during the remainder of the year in
the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>On the 24th of September, 1778, Colonel Lord
Macleod received orders to raise a second battalion to
the regiment. Each battalion was to consist of fifty
serjeants, fifty corporals, twenty drummers and fifers,
two pipers, and a thousand privates.</p>

<p>At this period the following officers had been appointed
to the <span class="smcap">Seventy-third Highland</span> Regiment.</p>

<span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>In January 1779 the first battalion of the regiment,
commanded by Colonel Lord John Macleod, embarked
for the East Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>The second battalion, one thousand strong, embarked
at Fort George in Scotland, in March 1779, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. George Mackenzie
(brother of Lord Macleod), and proceeded to Portsmouth,
from thence it went on in transports to Plymouth,
where the battalion landed, and was encamped
upon Maker Heights until the 27th of November
following.</p>

<p>The Court of Versailles had now engaged that of
Madrid to take a part in the contest, and on the 16th
of June 1779 the Spanish ambassador had presented a
manifesto at St. James’s, equivalent to a declaration of
war, and immediately departed from London. During
the summer the siege of Gibraltar was commenced by
the Spaniards, the reduction of that important fortress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
being one of the principal objects of Spain in becoming
a party to the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>The vessels conveying the first battalion formed part
of a fleet escorted by Rear-Admiral Sir Edward
Hughes, which on the passage touched at Goree, upon
the coast of Africa. Goree being evacuated by the
French for the purpose of fortifying Senegal, which
had been captured by them early in the year, was
occupied by a British force, left for that purpose by
Sir Edward Hughes.</p>

<p>After quitting Goree, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the fleet proceeeed'">the fleet proceeded</ins> to the
Cape of Good Hope, at that time in possession of the
Dutch, and there landed the sick. The fleet was
detained for three months in Table Bay, for the purpose
of refreshment and recovery of the sick, after
which it sailed for India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780.<br />
<span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>After the breaking up of the camp on Maker
Heights, the second battalion embarked for Gibraltar
in transports, under convoy of Admiral Sir George
Rodney. When in the Bay of Biscay, the British
encountered, on the 8th of January 1780, a valuable
Spanish convoy belonging to the Caracca company,
consisting of fifteen merchantmen, with a ship of sixty-four
guns, and two frigates, the whole of which were
captured. Sir George Rodney being compelled to employ
many of the crews of the ships of war in manning
the prizes, called upon Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. George
Mackenzie for the services of the second battalion
of the regiment as <em>Marines</em>. In a few days after the
men were distributed for this purpose, the fleet defeated,
on the 16th of January, off Cape St. Vincent, a
squadron of eleven sail of the line, commanded by
Admiral Don Juan de Langara. One Spanish ship
of seventy guns blew up in the beginning of the
action. The Spanish admiral’s ship of eighty guns,
and three of seventy, were taken; one of seventy guns
ran on shore, and another was lost on the breakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing further transpired during the remainder of
the voyage, and on the 18th of January 1780 the
second battalion disembarked at Gibraltar, then closely
blockaded by the Spaniards, who had despatched Don
Juan de Langara to intercept the British admiral.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>The first battalion had, in the meantime, continued on
its voyage to India, and on the 20th of January 1780
anchored in Madras Roads, being twelve months from
the time of leaving England. The battalion landed
immediately at Fort St. George, and after remaining
there about a month was removed to Poonamallee.</p>

<p>The intricate politics of India gave rise to a war in
that country. Hyder Ali, the son of a petty chief in
the Mysore, had risen to the chief command of
the army of that state, and when the rajah died,
leaving his eldest son a minor, Hyder assumed the
guardianship of the youthful prince, whom he placed
under restraint, and seized on the reins of government.
Having a considerable territory under his
control, he maintained a formidable military establishment,
which he endeavoured to bring into a high state
of discipline and efficiency. Hyder, now Sultan of
Mysore, formed a league with the French, and entered
into a confederacy with the Nizam of the Deccan, the
Mahrattas, and other of the native powers, for the
purpose of expelling the British from India.</p>

<p>In July 1780, Hyder Ali, having passed the Ghauts
(as the passes in the mountains on both sides of the
Indian peninsula are termed), burst like a torrent into
the Carnatic, while his son, Tippoo Saib, advanced
with a large body of cavalry against the northern
Circars, and the villages in the vicinity of Madras were
attacked by parties of the enemy’s horse.</p>

<p>These events occasioned the first battalion of the
regiment to be ordered to proceed to join the army
which was being assembled at St. Thomas’s Mount,
under the command of Major-General Sir Hector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Munro, K.B., consisting entirely of the troops of the
Honorable East India Company, with the exception
of the <em>Seventy-third</em>, then about 800 strong.</p>

<p>Sir Hector Munro’s army amounted to upwards of
4,000 men, and was thus composed:&mdash;</p>

<p>With the army were also thirty field-pieces and
howitzers, together with four battering twenty-four
pounders.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Indian army marched to Conjeveram,
sixty miles westward of Madras, where it was to be
joined by a detachment from the northward, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Baillie.</p>

<p>At this period the Sultan of Mysore was engaged
in besieging <em>Arcot</em>, the capital of the Carnatic, which
was invested by the enemy on the 21st of August.
The movement of Sir Hector Munro’s force caused
Hyder Ali to raise the siege; he then detached his son,
Tippoo Saib, with a large body of horse and foot,
amounting to 24,000 men and twelve guns, to intercept
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, whose junction with the
main army had been ordered.</p>

<p>In this manœuvre Tippoo Saib succeeded, and Major-General
Sir Hector Munro was compelled to detach
Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher with a thousand men to reinforce
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie. The flank companies of
the first battalion of the <em>Seventy-third</em> formed part of this
detachment; the grenadier company was commanded by
Lieutenant the Honorable John Lindsay, and the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
company by Captain, afterwards General the Right
Hon. Sir David Baird, Bart. and G.C.B.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On the 6th of September, Lieut.-Colonel Baillie was
attacked at Perambaukum by the division under Tippoo
Saib, and on the 9th of that month was joined by the
detachment under Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher. On the
following day they were attacked by Hyder’s whole
army, and the officers and men of this ill-fated detachment
were either killed, taken, or dispersed.</p>

<p>The following graphic description of this unequal
contest with Hyder’s whole army, the division under
Tippoo Saib acting in concert, is given by Captain
Innes Munro, of the <em>Seventy-third</em>, who published a
“Narrative of the Military Operations on the Coromandel
Coast from 1780 to 1784:”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lieut.-Colonel Baillie could but make a feeble
resistance against so superior a force; but his little
band yet gallantly supported a very unequal fire, until
their whole ammunition had either been blown up
or expended, which of course silenced the British
artillery. Hyder’s guns upon this drew nearer and
nearer at every discharge, while each shot was attended
with certain and deadly effect. Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie’s detachment, seeing their artillery
silenced and remaining inactive while exposed to
certain destruction, very naturally became dismayed;
which the enemy no sooner perceived than they
made a movement for a general charge and advanced
on all quarters to a close attack. At this dangerous
and trying juncture, sufficient to damp the spirits of
the most intrepid, all the camp-followers rushed in
confusion through the ranks of every battalion, and
in an instant threw the whole into disorder. The
black troops, finding themselves in this calamitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
situation, relinquished every hope of success; and,
notwithstanding the extraordinary exertions of their
European officers, were no more to be rallied. But
such of the Europeans as had fallen into disorder by
this irregularity, quickly united again in compact
order, headed by their gallant commander, who was
at this time much wounded; and, being joined by all
the Sepoy officers, planted themselves upon a rising
bank of sand in their vicinity, where they valiantly
resolved to defend themselves to the last extremity.</p>

<p>“History cannot produce an instance, for fortitude,
cool intrepidity, and desperate resolution, to equal
the exploits of this heroic band. In numbers, now
reduced to five hundred, they were opposed by no
less than one hundred thousand enraged barbarians,
who seldom grant quarter. The mind, in the contemplation
of such a scene, and such a situation as
theirs was, is filled at once with admiration, with
astonishment, with horror, and with awe. To behold
formidable and impenetrable bodies of horse, of infantry,
and of artillery, advancing from all quarters,
flashing savage fury, levelling the numberless instruments
of slaughter, and darting destruction around,
was a scene to appal even something more than the
strongest human resolution; but it was beheld by
this little band with the most undaunted and immovable
firmness. Distinct bodies of horse came on
successively to the charge, with strong parties of
infantry placed in the intervals, whose fire was discharged
in showers; but the deliberate and well-leveled
platoons of the British musketry had such a
powerful effect as to repulse several different attacks.
Like the swelling waves of the ocean, however, when
agitated by a storm, fresh columns incessantly poured
in upon them with redoubled fury, which at length
brought so many to the ground, and weakened their
fire so considerably, that they were unable longer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
withstand the dreadful and tremendous shock; and
the field soon presented a picture of the most inhuman
cruelties and unexampled carnage.</p>

<p>“The last and awful struggle was marked by the
clashing of arms and shields, the snorting and kicking
of horses, the snapping of spears, the glistening of
bloody swords, oaths and imprecations; concluding
with the groans and cries of bruised and mutilated
men, wounded horses tumbling to the ground upon
expiring soldiers, and the hideous roaring of elephants,
stalking to and fro, and wielding their
dreadful chains alike amongst friends and foes.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>“Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher and twenty-nine European
officers, with one hundred and fifty-five European
rank and file, were killed; Lieut.-Colonel Baillie,
with thirty-four officers, and almost all the European
privates, were miserably wounded; sixteen officers
and privates, from a Divine protection, and the generous
clemency of the French hussars, remained
unhurt, who, with the rest, were all made prisoners.
The whole of the sepoys were either killed, taken,
or dispersed.”</p>

<p>The flank companies were almost annihilated. Captain
Baird received seven wounds, and Lieutenant the Hon.
John Lindsay nine; both were made prisoners.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Philip Melvill<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was totally disabled by
his wounds, and was conveyed to Hyder’s camp, where
many other wounded prisoners were crowded together
in one tent, so as to prevent a moment’s ease or rest.
They were afterwards confined at Bangalore, where
they endured the greatest suffering for three years and
a half, when, peace being concluded, the captives were
released.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Lieutenent William Gunn'">Lieutenant William Gunn</ins>, of the grenadiers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Lieutenant Geddes Mackenzie, of the light company,
were killed.</p>

<p>These were the whole of the officers serving with the
two companies. Of the non-commissioned officers and
privates only two men joined the battalion, and those
were found in the jungle desperately wounded.</p>

<p>The melancholy fate of these companies rendered it
necessary for Colonel Lord Macleod to form two new
flank companies from the battalion.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, Major
General Sir Hector Munro retired with the army to
Chingleput, much pressed on the march by the enemy.
The wounded and sick being left at Chingleput, the
army went into cantonments on Choultry Plain for the
rainy season, which had set in. The troops in the
retreat had suffered severely from fatigue and want of
provisions.</p>

<p>Captain Alexander Gilchrist, of the grenadiers,
whose ill-health prevented him from being with his
company when Lieut.-Colonel Baillie was attacked,
died at this period<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, and Lieutenant Alexander
Mackenzie was wounded, together with several soldiers,
in skirmishes with the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>After the British fleet had departed from Gibraltar
the Spaniards renewed the blockade by sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
attempted to destroy the vessels in the harbour by
fire-ships, but failed. Towards the close of the year
provisions again became short. A limited supply was
occasionally obtained from the Moors. The effects of
the scurvy were mitigated by cultivating vegetables on
the rock; and the brave defenders of the fortress maintained
their attitude of defiance to the power of Spain.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurens, late President of the American Congress,
having been captured in his passage to Holland
by the British, papers were found on him showing that
a treaty of alliance was on the point of conclusion between
the Americans and the States General. Great
Britain in consequence declared war against Holland on
the 20th of December, and thus became engaged with a
fourth enemy, exclusive of the hostile powers in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781.<br />
<span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>Upon the 17th of January 1781, the army being re-assembled,
took the field under the command of Lieut.-General
Sir Eyre Coote, K.B., Commander-in-Chief in
India. At this period the strength of the first battalion
did not exceed five hundred men. Hyder Ali was then
in the Tanjore country, committing every species of
outrage and devastation.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1781, Colonel Lord Macleod
received the local rank of Major-General in the East
Indies. In June Sir Eyre Coote moved the army along
the coast southerly, towards Cuddalore, where his out-posts
were attacked by Tippoo Saib, who was repulsed.
The British commander afterwards marched his whole
force to Chillumborem, upon the Coleroon, where the
enemy had a large magazine of grain.</p>

<p>The pagoda was attacked by the piquets under the
command of Captain John Shaw, of the first battalion,
but the detachment was repulsed, and that officer
wounded.</p>

<p>Hyder Ali, being apprehensive for the safety of
Chillumborem, moved his army in the direction of that
place from Tanjore and Trichinopoly, while Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Sir Eyre Coote, with the view of obtaining
supplies from the shipping, proceeded towards Cuddalore.
Hyder, by forced marches and manœuvres, had
nearly surrounded the British on the plains of <em>Porto
Novo</em>, about two days’ march to the southward of
Cuddalore.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning of the 1st of July,
Sir Eyre Coote put his army of about 8,000 men in
movement, while that of the enemy, computed at
100,000, was observed to range itself in order of battle.</p>

<p>The army of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote formed
on the plain in two lines; the first battalion was commanded
by Colonel James Craufurd<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (Lord Macleod
having returned to England), and had its station in the
first line under the orders of Major General Sir Hector
Munro. Major General James Stuart commanded the
second line. The action commenced by an advanced
movement of the English troops, and the contest was
sustained with great spirit by both parties until night,
when the firing ceased, and the British remained masters
of the field.</p>

<p>The veteran chief, Sir Eyre Coote, was so well
pleased with the conduct of the battalion upon this
occasion that he was heard to exclaim, addressing himself
in the heat of the battle to one of the pipers,
“Well done, my brave fellow, you shall have silver pipes
when the battle is over!” The general did not forget
his promise, and in addition to a general order expressive
of his sense of the gallantry and steadiness of the battalion
in the battle of <em>Porto Novo</em>, he presented a
handsome pair of silver pipes (value one hundred pagodas<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>)
to the corps, upon which was engraved a suitable
inscription; this he desired might be preserved as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lasting monument of his approbation of its conduct in
that battle, the result of which enabled Sir Eyre Coote
to reach Cuddalore, the point of destination, on the
4th of July.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the army was moved to St.
Thomas’s Mount.</p>

<p>On the 3d of August the force from Bengal, under
the orders of Colonel Pearse, arrived and formed a
junction with Sir Eyre Coote’s army at Pulicat, to
which place the army had moved in order to facilitate
that important object. The British force now amounted
to twelve thousand men.</p>

<p>The first brigade, composed entirely of Europeans,
was commanded by Colonel Craufurd, of the present
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, and had its station generally
in the centre of the line. Major General Sir Hector
Munro commanded the right wing, and Colonel Pearse
the left.</p>

<p>In August, Major James Mackenzie of the battalion
died, universally regretted. His exertions in the early
part of the campaign had brought on illness, which terminated
his career.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August the preparations that had
been carried on for the siege of <em>Arcot</em>, which had been
taken by Hyder Ali in the previous year, and for the
relief of <em>Vellore</em> being completed, the Anglo-Indian
army was put in movement. On the 20th of August
<em>Tripassoor</em> was retaken, by which capture a very large
supply of grain fell into the hands of the British. The
camp of Hyder’s main army was at Conjeveram, and
every exertion was made by his detachments to interrupt
the progress of the British troops.</p>

<p>The British, on the 27th of August, came in sight of
the enemy, drawn up in order of battle upon the very
ground where Lieut.-Colonel Baillie had met his defeat,
a position which the religious notions of Hyder Ali
induced him to consider fortunate. Thus encouraged or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
inspired, he seemed determined to hazard a second
general action, and accordingly commenced the attack
by a smart cannonade, when an obstinate contest ensued,
which lasted the whole day, and which terminated in
his defeat, and his being forced to retire from all his
positions.</p>

<p>There was a circumstance peculiar to this field of
battle which stamped it with aggravated horrors. It is
ably and feelingly described by Captain Munro in his
Narrative, from which the following is extracted.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>“Perhaps there come not within the wide range of
human imagination scenes more affecting, or circumstances
more touching, than many of our army had
that day to witness and to bear. On the very spot
where they stood lay strewed amongst their feet the
relics of their dearest fellow soldiers and friends, who
near twelve months before had been slain by the
hands of those very inhuman monsters that now appeared
a second time eager to complete the work of
blood. One poor soldier, with the tear of affection
glistening in his eye, picked up the decaying spatter-dash
of his valued brother, with the name yet entire
upon it, which the tinge of blood and effects of weather
had kindly spared. Another discovered the club or
plaited hair of his bosom friend, which he himself had
helped to form, and knew by the tie and still remaining
colour. A third mournfully recognised the feather
which had decorated the cap of his inseparable companion.
The scattered clothes and wings of the flank
companies of the <em>Seventy-third</em> were everywhere
perceptible, as also their helmets and skulls, both of
which bore the marks of many furrowed cuts. These
horrid spectacles, too melancholy to dwell upon, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
they melted the hardest hearts, inflamed our soldiers
with an enthusiasm and thirst of revenge such as
render men invincible; but their ardour was necessarily
checked by the involved situation of the army.”</p>

<p>Upon this horrid spot the army halted two days, and
it then retired to Tripassoor, to secure provisions. At
this period the health of Major-General Sir Hector
Munro compelled him to leave the army.</p>

<p>On the 19th of September, Lieut.-General Sir Eyre
Coote made a movement towards <em>Vellore</em>, the relief of
which place Hyder Ali appeared determined to oppose,
by occupying in order of battle the Pass of <em>Sholingur</em>,
at the same time making very spirited attacks against
the fortress of Vellore.</p>

<p>Upon the 27th of September, Colonel Craufurd, now
second in command, received the orders of the Commander-in-Chief
to move the British army to the
front.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Hyder, confident of success, made a forward
movement to meet his opponents, when a general
action commenced. A detachment, commanded by
Colonel Edmonstone, (of which the flank companies of
the first battalion formed part,) succeeded in turning
the left flank of the enemy, and fell upon his camp and
rear. The day closed by the total defeat of Hyder’s
troops, who were pursued by the cavalry until sunset.</p>

<p>Under circumstances the most distressing and unpromising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
but with the hope of obtaining the supplies
of provisions of which the army was quite destitute,
and for which no previous arrangement had been made
by the Government, Lieut. General Sir Eyre Coote,
on the 1st of October, boldly pushed through the
Sholingur Pass, and after a march of two days encamped
at Altamancherry, in the Polygar country.
Here, by the friendly aid and kindness of Bum-Raze,
one of the Polygar princes, the troops were well supplied
with every requisite.</p>

<p>The British camp was moved on the 26th of October
to Pollipet, and the sick and wounded were sent to
Tripassoor. Vellore was also relieved. This desirable
object being effected, and the army reinforced by
Colonel Laing with a hundred Europeans from Vellore,
it proceeded to the attack of Chittoor, which, after
a gallant resistance, capitulated.</p>

<p>With a view to get the British from a country
so very inaccessible, Hyder Ali proceeded to the
attack of Tripassoor, and on the 20th of November
Sir Eyre Coote retired out of the Pollams, through the
Naggary Pass, which obliged the enemy to raise the
siege of Tripassoor, and to retire to Arcot. The
campaign closed by the recapture of Chittoor by the
enemy.</p>

<p>On the 2d of December, the monsoon having set in,
the army broke up its camp on the Koilatoor Plain,
and the different corps marched into cantonments in
the neighbourhood of Madras.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1781, the battalion was
commanded by Captain John Shaw.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>While the first battalion had been thus actively employed
in India, the second battalion was engaged in
the gallant defence of <em>Gibraltar</em>, the garrison of which
was again relieved, in April 1781, by the arrival of a
numerous fleet under Vice-Admiral Darby.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, relinquishing all hope of reducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the fortress by blockade, resolved to try the power
of their numerous artillery. Scarcely had the fleet
cast anchor, when the enemy’s batteries opened,
and the fire of upwards of one hundred guns and
mortars enveloped the fortress in a storm of war; a
number of gun-boats augmented the iron tempest
which beat against the rock, and the houses of the
inhabitants were soon in ruins. On the 8th of May,
Captain James Foulis, of the second battalion of the
regiment, was wounded in the lines.</p>

<p>On the night of the 17th of September the following
incident relating to the battalion occurred in an attack
of the enemy, the account of which is extracted from
the “History of the Siege of Gibraltar,” by Colonel
John Drinkwater, of the late Seventy-second Regiment,
or Royal Manchester Volunteers:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A shell during the above attack fell in an embrasure
opposite the King’s lines bomb-proof, killed one
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-third</span>, and wounded another of the
same corps. The case of the latter was singular, and
will serve to enforce the maxim, that, even in the
most dangerous cases, we should never despair of a
recovery whilst life remains. This unfortunate man
was knocked down by the wind of the shell, which,
instantly bursting, killed his companion, and mangled
him in a most dreadful manner. His head was
terribly fractured, his left arm broken in two places,
one of his legs shattered, the skin and muscles
torn off part of his right hand, the middle finger
broken to pieces, and his whole body most severely
bruised, and marked with gunpowder. He presented
so horrid an object to the surgeons, that they had not
the smallest hopes of saving his life, and were at a
loss what part to attend to first. He was that
evening trepanned, a few days afterwards his leg
was amputated, and other wounds and fractures
dressed. Being possessed of a most excellent constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
nature performed wonders in his favour, and
in eleven weeks the cure was completely effected.
His name is Donald Ross, and he long continued to
enjoy his sovereign’s bounty in a pension of ninepence
a day for life.”</p>

<p>On the 4th of November, Lieutenant John Fraser,
of the second battalion, had his leg shot off on Montague’s
Bastion, and two of the soldiers of the battalion
were likewise wounded by the enemy’s fire.</p>

<p>General Eliott, afterwards Lord Heathfield, which
title was conferred for the services performed by him
when Governor of Gibraltar, in order to free himself
from the contiguity of the besiegers, resolved to make
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i>. The favourable opportunity presented itself;
and, on the evening of the 26th of November, the
following garrison order was issued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Countersign, Steady.</span>&mdash;All the grenadiers and
light infantry in the garrison, and all the men of the
Twelfth and Hardenberg’s regiments, with the officers
and non-commissioned officers on duty, to be immediately
relieved and join their regiments; to form a
detachment, consisting of the Twelfth and Hardenberg’s
regiments complete; the grenadiers and light
infantry of all the other regiments; one captain, three
lieutenants, ten non-commissioned officers, and a hundred
artillery; three engineers, seven officers, ten
non-commissioned officers, overseers, with a hundred
and sixty workmen from the line, and forty workmen
from the artificer corps; each man to have thirty-six
rounds of ammunition, with a good flint in his piece,
and another in his pocket; the whole to be commanded
by Brigadier-General Ross, and to assemble on the
red sands, at twelve o’clock this night, to make a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i> upon the enemy’s batteries. The thirty-ninth
and fifty-eighth regiments to parade at the same
hour, on the grand parade, under the command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Brigadier-General Picton, to sustain the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i>, if
necessary.”</p></div>

<p>The flank companies of the second battalion, consisting
of eight officers, ten serjeants, and 202 rank and
file, formed part of the centre column. The moon shone
brightly as the soldiers assembled on the sands at midnight.
Between two and three o’clock darkness overspread
the country, and the troops issued silently from
the fortress. They were challenged and fired upon by
the enemy’s sentries, but the British soldiers rushed
forward with their native ardour, overpowered the
Spanish guards, and captured the batteries in gallant
style. The enemy’s soldiers, instead of defending the
works, fled in dismay, and communicated the panic to
the troops in their rear. The wooden batteries were
soon prepared for fire; the flames spread with astonishing
rapidity, and a column of fire and smoke arose from
the works, illuminating the surrounding objects, and
shedding a fiery lustre upon this unparalleled scene.</p>

<p>In an hour the object of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i> was effected; trains
were laid to the enemy’s magazines, and the soldiers
withdrew. As they entered the fortress, tremendous
explosions shook the ground, and rising columns of
smoke, flame, and burning timber proclaimed the destruction
of the enemy’s immense stores of gunpowder
to be completed. General Eliott declared in orders,
“The bearing and conduct of the whole detachment,
officers, seamen, and soldiers, on this glorious occasion,
surpass my utmost acknowledgments.”</p>

<p>For several days the Spaniards appeared confounded
at their disgrace. The smoke of the burning batteries
continued to rise, and no attempt was made to extinguish
the flames; but several executions took place in
their camp, probably of persons who fled so precipitately
from the batteries. In the beginning of December they
began to arouse themselves, and a thousand workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
commenced labouring to restore the batteries, in which
they were retarded by the fire of the garrison.</p>

<p>While the besiegers were thus employed, the gallant
defenders of the fortress were equally indefatigable;
every serjeant, drummer, musician, officer’s servant,
and private soldier, used the musket, shovel, and pick-axe,
as his services were necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782.<br />
<span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>At the opening of the campaign in India, in the
beginning of 1782, the army did not muster a larger
force than at the commencement of the former year.
The first and most important object in view was the
relief of <em>Vellore</em>, kept in strict blockade by the enemy.
The safety of this fortress was of paramount consequence,
being the only key the British possessed to the
Passes of the Ghauts, through which an invasion of the
enemy’s country could be accomplished; and the army
being put in movement, pushed through the Sholingur
Pass, and by the 11th of January the relief of <em>Vellore</em>,
with a supply of rice for six months, was fully effected.
After the accomplishment of this object the army
retired, and on the 20th of January arrived at Poonamallee,
having lost upon this expedition six officers
and about thirty Europeans, with one hundred sepoys,
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is extracted from the narrative
of Captain Munro, relating to the fall of John
Mackay, a corporal of the battalion, in one of the
skirmishes with the enemy, when the army was on the
march to Vellore:&mdash;“For the satisfaction of my Highland
friends, I take this opportunity of commemorating
the fall of John Mackay, <em>alias</em> Donn, a corporal
in the <em>Seventy-third</em> (now <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>) regiment,
son of Robert Donn, the famous Highland
bard, whose singular talent for the beautiful and
extemporaneous composition of Gaelic poetry was
held in such esteem by the Highland Society. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
son of the bard has frequently revived the drooping
spirits of his countrymen upon the march, by singing
in a pleasant manner the humorous and lively productions
of his father. He was killed by a cannon
ball on the 13th of January, and on the same evening
was interred by his disconsolate comrades with
all the honors of war.”</p>

<p>For the first three months of the year 1782, the
army of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote was kept in a
state of inactivity at St. Thomas’s Mount, where it would
appear the Government of the presidency, apprehensive
for its own safety, had detained this force, while a
judicious movement to Porto Novo might have prevented
the junction of the forces under Tippoo Saib
with the strong reinforcement of French troops that
had arrived from Europe on board the fleet of Admiral
Suffrein, or at all events have prevented the loss of
Permacoil and Cuddalore.</p>

<p>At length Sir Eyre Coote, having been reinforced by
the Seventy-eighth, afterwards the Seventy-second
regiment, recently arrived from England, was permitted
to put the army in movement. In the beginning of
April he marched in a southerly direction by Carangooly
and Wandewash towards the enemy, encamped upon
the Red Hills of Pondicherry. The object, which the
Commander-in-chief appeared to have in view, was to
separate the French and Mysorean troops, and he
manœuvred accordingly between Chitaput and Arnee,
until Hyder Ali, apprehensive for the safety of the
latter place, where he had established magazines, made
a rapid movement on the 2d of June, so as to overtake
and attack the rear-guard of the British, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel John Elphinston<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, of the <em>Seventy-third</em>,
who maintained his ground with great spirit and intrepidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
until the line had completed its formation. The
troops were ordered to advance immediately upon the
enemy’s guns, the action became very warm, and the foe
was soon forced across the river of <em>Arnee</em>, and in the pursuit
several tumbrils were taken by the Honorable Captain
James Lindsay, of the battalion. This gallant and
intelligent officer, perceiving an enemy’s battalion endeavouring
to extricate the tumbrils in the bed of the
river, dashed forward at the head of his grenadier company,
supported by the remainder of the corps under
Major George Mackenzie’s command, and, quickly dispersing
all opposed to his progress, took possession
of his prize. This movement of the <em>Seventy-third</em> was
supported on the left by a battalion of Bengal Sepoys,
who had captured one of the enemy’s guns, and both
corps, equally animated by success, pushed on, driving
the enemy before them as long as pursuit was prudent.</p>

<p>The conduct of Captain the Honorable James Lindsay,
although he had acted without orders, received all
the praise it merited from the commander-in-chief,
Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote. At the battle of <em>Arnee</em>
the staff of the regimental colour was shattered by a
cannon ball, and the ensign severely wounded.</p>

<p>The army encamped for the night on the field of
battle, and on the following morning took up a position
before Arnee; but a scarcity of grain compelled the
general to retrace his steps towards Madras, and on
the 20th of June he arrived at St. Thomas’s Mount.</p>

<p>In the months of July and August the army made
two expeditions, one to Wandewash, in which it was
foiled by the active and politic Hyder, the other for
the relief of <em>Vellore</em>, in which it was more fortunate,
having succeeded in throwing a large quantity of grain
into that fortress.</p>

<p>The siege of Cuddalore having been determined on,
the army moved on the 26th of August in a southerly
direction, and on the 4th of September halted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Red Hills of Pondicherry. Deserters reported the
garrison of Cuddalore to consist of 800 Europeans, 300
Africans, and 600 Sepoys, who, having expelled the
inhabitants, and covered the walls with cannon, were
resolved to defend the place to the last extremity. The
failure of the supplies, which Sir Eyre Coote had been
led to expect from Madras by the fleet, excited so much
anxiety and disappointment in the veteran’s mind, that
a severe illness ensued, which obliged him to quit the
army, and ultimately to proceed to Bengal for the
benefit of his health. The command then devolved
upon Major-General James Stuart, who commenced
his retreat in the evening of the 10th of October.</p>

<p>On the 15th of October, the monsoon set in with
unusual severity, and the army went into cantonments
in the vicinity of Madras. Hyder Ali, at the
same time, took up his old position near Arcot. Shortly
after, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton, with a
large fleet from England, came to anchor in Madras
roads, having on board considerable reinforcements for
the army, which was joined in the cantonments by the
Twenty-third Light Dragoons, the 101st and 102d
British regiments, and the Fifteenth regiment of Hanoverian
Infantry.</p>

<p>In the month of December occurred the decease of
that extraordinary man, <span class="smcap">Hyder Ali</span>, who was succeeded,
without any of the commotions usual in the
East on such occasions, by his son, <span class="smcap">Tippoo Saib</span>,
to whom he left a kingdom of his own acquisition,
which made him one of the most powerful princes in
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>All ordinary means of attack appearing to be unavailing
against the resolute garrison of Gibraltar (of
which the second battalion of the regiment formed part),
stupendous preparations were made on a new principle,
and floating batteries were constructed with great art
and labour. These were accounted the most perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
contrivance of the kind ever seen. The combined
power of France and Spain was directed against the
fortress. The Duke of Crillon assumed the command of
the besieging army, and was assisted by a celebrated
French engineer, Monsieur d’Arcon, and by Admiral
Moreno, and a French army arrived to take part in the
siege.</p>

<p>A crisis was evidently approaching, and in the spring
and summer of 1782 the garrison of Gibraltar made
preparations with cool determination for the hour of
trial. The officers and soldiers appeared to be impressed
with their peculiar situation; an important
fortress was confided to their protection; they had
defended it against the efforts of the Spanish army and
navy upwards of two years; and the eyes of all Europe
were directed towards them. The damaged works
were carefully repaired, new ones were constructed,
extensive subterraneous works were prepared, and
forges for heating red-hot shot were got ready. Every
serjeant, drummer, musician, and officer’s servant, as
well as the corporals and private soldiers, used a shovel,
pickaxe, or musket, according as their services were
required. The effect of the red-hot shot was proved
on some of the enemy’s wooden batteries on the sands,
which were speedily destroyed.</p>

<p>The Duke of Crillon anticipated the most signal
success from the extensive preparations he was making.
His camp was visited by princes of the royal blood of
France, by Spanish nobility, and other dignified characters
of Europe, who came to be spectators of the
fall of the fortress, under the heavy fire of artillery
which was about to be opened upon it. The new batteries
on shore were unmasked, and fired a volley of
sixty shells, which was followed by the thunder of one
hundred and seventy guns of large calibre. Thus was
Gibraltar assailed by a storm of iron, which threatened
to reduce the fortress to a heap of ruins, and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
only a prelude to the tremendous fire which was afterwards
opened upon the garrison. Lieutenant Phipps
Wharton, of the second battalion, was dangerously
wounded by the enemy’s fire.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September, the ten battering ships
took their station before the fortress, in the presence of
the combined fleets of France and Spain. The enemy’s
camp and neighbouring hills were crowded with spectators
from various parts of Europe, to witness the effect
of these stupendous vessels, and such a storm of war
was opened upon the garrison as was probably never
heard before since the invention of cannon. The batteries
of the fortress answered this tremendous fire with
vigour, and the deafening thunder of four hundred
pieces of heavy artillery was heard for many miles.
For some hours the attack and defence were so equally
well supported as scarcely to admit any appearance
of superiority in the cannonade on either side. The
wonderful construction of the battering ships seemed
to bid defiance to the heaviest ordnance; shells rebounded
from their tops, and a thirty-two pound shot
scarcely seemed to make any impression on them. The
effect of the red-hot shot was doubted; sometimes
smoke came from the ships, but the fire-engines within
soon occasioned it to cease, and the result was uncertain.
The fire was, however, persevered in, and incessant
showers of red-hot bullets, shells, and carcases flew
through the air. In the afternoon the effects of the
red-hot shot became apparent, and volumes of smoke
issued from the flag-ship; the Admiral’s second ship
was perceived to be in the same condition, and confusion
prevailed. The Spaniards expected that the
firing of red-hot bullets could not be persevered in
beyond a few rounds; but the fire was continued with
the same precision and vivacity as cold shot. The
effects of the hot balls occasioned the enemy’s cannonade
to abate, and about eight o’clock it almost totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
ceased. The battering ships made signals to inform the
combined fleets of their extreme danger and distress,
and several boats were sent to their aid. At this
period the fire of the garrison produced great carnage,
and the most pitiable cries and groans were heard, as
the incessant showers of shot and shells were poured
into the floating batteries. Soon after midnight one
ship was in flames, and by two o’clock she appeared one
sheet of fire from head to stern; a second was soon in
the same state; the flames enabled the British artillery
to point their guns with precision, and soon after three
o’clock six more ships exhibited the effects of the red-hot
shot. The burning ships exhibited one of the
grandest spectacles of destruction ever beheld; and
amidst this dreadful scene of conflagration, the British
seamen in boats were seen endeavouring to rescue the
Spaniards from the blazing ships. They preserved
between three and four hundred; and while they were
thus engaged, one of the ships blew up with a dreadful
explosion; four others met the same fate before seven
o’clock, and another shortly afterwards, and the remainder
burnt to the water’s edge, their magazines
having been inundated; not one could be preserved as
a trophy.</p>

<p>Thus did the mighty efforts of France and Spain end
in defeat and destruction, and the gallant efforts of the
brave soldiers who defended Gibraltar elicited the admiration
of the nations in Europe. In England the
most enthusiastic applause was universal; illuminations
and other modes of testifying the joy of the people
followed the receipt of the news of the destruction of
the boasted invincible battering ships, and every family
which could claim a defender of Gibraltar belonging to
it was proud of the honor. The loss of the garrison,
on the 13th and 14th of September, was limited to one
officer, two serjeants, and thirteen rank and file killed;
five officers and sixty-three rank and file wounded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that of the enemy exceeded two thousand officers and
soldiers. Captain Alexander Mackenzie, of the second
battalion, was one of the officers wounded.</p>

<p>Although the enemy gave up all hopes of reducing
Gibraltar by force of arms, yet some expectation was
entertained, that, if the blockade was continued, the
garrison might be forced to surrender from the want of
provisions; the combined fleet therefore remained in
the bay, the besieging army continued in the lines, and
about a thousand shots were fired every day from the
Spanish batteries. The garrison was encouraged to
continue resolute in the defence of the fortress by
assurances of their Sovereign’s favour and high approbation.
The principal Secretary of State, writing
to General Eliott, stated,&mdash;“I am honored with His
Majesty’s commands to assure you, in the strongest
terms, that no encouragement shall be wanting to the
brave officers and soldiers under your command. His
royal approbation of the past will no doubt be a
powerful incentive to future exertions, and I have the
King’s authority to assure you, that every distinguished
act of emulation and gallantry, which shall be performed
in the course of the siege by any, even of the
lowest rank, will meet with ample reward from his
gracious protection and favour.”</p>

<p>On the 4th of October Lieutenant Kenneth
Mackenzie, of the second battalion, was wounded
in the communication from the King’s to the Queen’s
lines.</p>

<p>In October the combined fleet was much damaged
by a storm, and soon afterwards a British naval force
arrived, and the garrison was again relieved, when two
regiments, the Twenty-fifth and Fifty-ninth, landed to
take part in the defence of the fortress.</p>

<p>On the 23d of November Lieutenant John Mackenzie,
of the second battalion, was dangerously
wounded by the enemy’s cannonade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1783.<br />
<span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>At the opening of the campaign of 1783, Tippoo Saib
encamped his army upon the plains of Arnee, where he
was joined by a strong detachment of French auxiliaries
from Cuddalore.</p>

<p>Major-General Stuart put the British army in movement,
having first in view the demolition of the useless
fortresses of Wandewash and Carangooly. He arrived
at the latter place on the 6th of February, and, leaving
there all heavy baggage and encumbrances, proceeded
lightly equipped towards Wandewash, the works of
which were accordingly destroyed. The army then
returned to Carangooly, which experienced the same
fate as Wandewash, and on the 23d of February arrived
at Poonamallee.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the siege of Gibraltar had terminated,
hostilities having ceased in February 1783, in consequence
of the preliminaries of the treaties between
Great Britain, France, and Spain having been signed
at Versailles on the 20th of the preceding month. The
second battalion during the siege was commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable George Mackenzie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>Notwithstanding private information having been
received from respectable sources, overland, of a peace
having been concluded between Great Britain and the
other belligerent powers in Europe, still the Madras
Government was determined to persevere in its original
plans for the attack of <em>Cuddalore</em>. With this view,
Major-General Stuart put the army in movement on
the 21st of April, marching by brigades in a southerly
direction. Major-General Stuart’s army consisted of
the present <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> and Seventy-second regiments,
the 101st regiment, a considerable body of
native troops, and a detachment of Hanoverians under
Colonel Wangenheim. Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston,
of the first battalion of the regiment, took the
lead, with the fifth brigade, to the command of
which he had been appointed, in consideration of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
distinguished conduct and important services in the
field.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart, of the Seventy-eighth
Highlanders (the present Seventy-second regiment),
commanded the first or European brigade, of which the
first battalion of the <em>Seventy-third</em> (now the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>)
regiment formed part, and which amounted to
sixteen hundred men.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston, in his advance,
possessed himself of Permacoil ruins, from whence
could be plainly distinguished the enemy’s advanced
parties upon the Red Hills of Pondicherry. The remainder
of the army joined at Permacoil on the 2d of
May.</p>

<p>About this period accounts were received of the
decease of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, which intelligence
threw a peculiar gloom over those officers and
men who had had the honor to serve under his command
in India. Major-General Stuart succeeded to
the command of the forces in India for the time
being.</p>

<p>After leaving Permacoil, the army advanced to Killinoor,
and from thence directed its course towards the
Red Hills of Pondicherry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>In May 1783, the second battalion embarked in
transports, and sailed from Gibraltar for Portsmouth,
where it landed in July following.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>On the 4th of June, Major-General Stuart placed the
British camp close to the Pannar River, about five
miles west of <em>Cuddalore</em>, behind which the French
army was descried in an entrenched camp.</p>

<p>The British crossed the Pannar River on the 6th of
June, without being molested, passed the Bandipollam
Hills, and took up a strong position not more than two
miles from the south face of the fortress of <em>Cuddalore</em>,
having their right flank covered by the sea, and the left
by the Bandipollam Hills. The enemy, commanded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
General de Bussy, had in the meantime been occupied
in throwing up works along his front.</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, Major-General Stuart had determined
upon attacking Monsieur de Bussy in his present
position, and issued preparatory orders accordingly.
At four o’clock in the morning of the 13th of June, the
action commenced by a movement from the British left
upon the right flank of the enemy. A very obstinate
and sanguinary contest ensued, and continued without
intermission until the evening, when both armies remained
upon the field of battle, and consequently each
claimed the victory.</p>

<p>In this action the first battalion of the regiment
highly distinguished itself, having wrested from the
enemy, in the course of the conflict, seven different
redoubts. The loss sustained by the battalion was very
severe, amounting in killed and wounded to 13 officers
and 272 men, being one half of the gross number in the
field. The battalion in this action was commanded by
Captain Hugh Lamont. The battalion had to regret
the loss of Captains the Honorable James Lindsay and
Alexander Mackenzie, who were killed. The former
officer commanded the Grenadier company.</p>

<p>The following flattering compliment formed part of
the general orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief
at the conclusion of the battle:&mdash;“I am also grateful
to Captain Lamont and the officers under his command,
who gallantly led the <em>precious remains</em> of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-third</span> Regiment through the most perilous
road to glory, until exactly one half of the officers
and men of the battalion were either killed or
wounded.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of June the English and French fleets
fought their last battle during this war. The former
commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, and
the latter by Monsieur Suffrein. The contest was perfectly
in view of both armies. The result obliged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
British admiral to proceed to Madras, while, to the
great embarrassment of the army under Major-General
Stuart, the French fleet was enabled to anchor in Cuddalore
Roads, and to afford supplies and reinforcements
to their troops.</p>

<p>The British prosecuted the siege of Cuddalore with
vigour, and on the 25th of June the first parallel was
completed. On that day the enemy made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i>
but was repulsed, after a severe contest, with considerable
loss. The commander of the party, Colonel the
Chevalier de Damas, was among the prisoners taken on
this occasion.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July a frigate arrived in Cuddalore
Roads, confirming the former intelligence, and bringing
the official accounts from England of a general peace
having been concluded. Hostilities in consequence
ceased. The English and French interchanged visits,
congratulations, and compliments, and became apparently
as cordial friends as they had before been determined
enemies.</p>

<p>By the 2d of August the British army had received
the supplies of which it stood greatly in want, and the
camp was immediately broken up, the troops proceeding
towards Madras, where they arrived on the 16th of
that month, at St. Thomas’s Mount.</p>

<p>The army shortly afterwards went into winter
quarters, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-third</span> occupying the fort and
cantonment of Arcot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>In August the second battalion marched from Hilsea
barracks to Stirling, where it was disbanded on the 3d
of October; and the officers belonging to the second
battalion, who were regimentally senior to those
serving with the first, had the option afforded them of
joining that battalion in the East Indies, at their own
expense, of which some availed themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784.</div>

<p>On the 11th of March 1784, a general peace was ratified
between the Honorable East India Company and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Tippoo Saib, and, shortly afterwards, the officers and
men, who had been made prisoners in the action fought
by Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, on the 10th of September
1780, were restored to their friends, after having endured
captivity in irons in an ungenial climate, and
most of them suffering from severe wounds.</p>

<p>The regiment had the gratification to receive Captains
David Baird and the Honorable John Lindsay. The
commission of the latter, as captain, had been antedated
to the 12th of September 1780. Both of these officers
had recovered from their wounds.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the year the regiment continued
at Arcot, and was only employed, beyond the
usual routine of duty in quarters, for a short time in
quelling a mutiny which broke out in the native
cavalry at Arnee. The regiment at this period was
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel William Dalrymple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785.</div>

<p>In the course of the month of June the regiment
was removed from Arcot to Fort St. George at
Madras, where it was joined by certain officers of the
late second battalion. Lieut.-Colonel Dalrymple having
returned to Great Britain, the regiment was commanded
by Brevet Colonel the Honorable George Mackenzie.</p>

<p>The regiment continued in quarters during the remainder
of the year at Fort St. George, and in the
town at Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1786.</div>

<p>In the year 1786 the numerical title of the regiment
was changed from Seventy-third to <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>;
and new colours were received from England, bearing
the number <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, which designation it has
since retained.</p>

<p>The regiment changed its quarters, in March, to
Wallajohabad and Chingleput, having nine companies
cantoned at the former station, and one at the latter
under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton Maxwell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1787.</div>

<p>On the 4th of June 1787, the commanding officer,
Colonel the Honorable George Mackenzie, died, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
short illness. His body was sent to Madras, and there
interred with the military honors due to his rank.
The senior major, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel John
Elphinston, succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy and
to the command of the regiment. Captain David
Baird was at the same time promoted to the rank of
major. The commissions of these officers were dated
5th of June 1787.</p>

<p>During the year 1787 no change of quarters took
place, and the regiment remained in cantonments at
Wallajohabad and Chingleput.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788.</div>

<p>In February 1788, in consequence of some disturbance
or alarm at the Bombay Presidency, the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> marched to Madras, and immediately
embarked on board the Company’s ships for Bombay.
The regiment was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Elphinston, and was about eight hundred strong.</p>

<p>After a favorable passage, the ships arrived at
Bombay in April, when the regiment immediately disembarked
and went into barracks, where it remained for
six months. The Seventy-fifth and Seventy-seventh
regiments having, in this interval, arrived at Bombay
from England, the services of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
became no longer necessary at that Presidency, and
the regiment proceeded in October to Madras, where
it arrived in December.</p>

<p>Five companies, under Lieut.-Colonel Elphinston,
occupied the barracks in Fort St. George, and the other
five companies proceeded to Poonamallee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789.</div>

<p>Major-General the Honorable William Gordon was
appointed colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment on
the 9th of April 1789, in succession to Major-General
John Lord Macleod, deceased.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1789, the five companies at
Poonamallee were removed to Tripassoor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790.</div>

<p>On the 16th of March 1790, the companies at Madras
and Tripassoor received orders to join a force which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was assembling at Wallajohabad, under the orders of
Colonel Thomas Musgrave, of the Seventy-sixth, in
consequence of the hostilities which Tippoo Saib had
commenced against the Rajah of Travancore, a faithful
British ally. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> arrived at Wallajohabad
on the 18th of March, and joined the other
troops, consisting of the nineteenth light dragoons,
fifty-second, and <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiments, the
third and fourth native cavalry, the first battalion
of coast artillery, and the second, fourth, ninth, fourteenth,
and twenty-fifth coast sepoys.</p>

<p>This force was put in movement on the 29th of
March, and proceeded towards Trichinopoly, which
it did not reach until the 29th of April, and found
there the following corps, under the command of
Colonel Brydges:&mdash;two King’s regiments, the thirty-sixth
and seventy-second; the second and fifth native
cavalry; the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, sixteenth,
twentieth, and twenty-third coast sepoys. At the same
time Colonel Deare, with three companies of Bengal
artillery, joined, the whole being under the orders of
Major-General Musgrave, to which rank he had been
promoted on the 28th of April 1790.</p>

<p>The army was immediately divided into brigades
and wings; Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart, of the Seventy-second
Highlanders, was appointed to command the left
wing, and Colonel Brydges, of the East India Company’s
service, the right; the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> and
seventy-second regiments, and first East India Company’s
European battalion, formed the second European
brigade, under Lieut.-Colonel Clarke, of the Company’s
service.</p>

<p>The whole of the cavalry and the advance were commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel, afterwards General Sir John
Floyd, of the nineteenth light dragoons, since disbanded.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May, Major-General (afterwards
Sir William) Medows assumed the command, and reviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the army, which on the 26th of that month
was put in movement towards the Coimbatore country.</p>

<p>The army reached Caroor, a fortified place, on the
15th of June, which the enemy abandoned on the
approach of the British, who remained in this position,
strengthening Caroor, and collecting grain, until the
2d of July, when they moved for Arrivacourchy,
arriving there on the 5th, and continuing their route
by Tooramboddy, arrived on the 10th of July at Daraporam.
At this latter place was found a large supply
of grain and other necessaries, which had been left by
the enemy.</p>

<p>During the march to Coimbatore, where the British
arrived on the 22d of July, Tippoo’s irregular horse
were very active in hovering around, for the purpose of
picking up stragglers and baggage.</p>

<p>The army halted at Coimbatore, and detachments
were sent off to reduce Dindigul, Errode, and <em>Palghautcherry</em>.
The flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment, commanded by Captains Phineas
M<sup>c</sup>Intosh and James Robertson, were employed upon
the latter service. In August the whole of the cavalry
and the advance had been pushed forward to the
Boovany, near to the Gudzelhetty Pass. Tippoo Saib,
profiting by the divided state of the British force,
descended with his whole army, and after a very severe
conflict obliged Lieut.-Colonel Floyd to fall back. The
troops from Coimbatore had marched to his support,
and on the junction being effected, Tippoo retired. The
British returned to Coimbatore on the 23d of September.</p>

<p>Upon the march of the main body, the flank companies
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> and Seventy-second were
withdrawn from the siege of <em>Palghautcherry</em>, and ordered
to take post in the fort of Coimbatore; and on the
return of the army they rejoined the regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The army was again put in motion on the 29th of
September, proceeding towards the Boovany by Shawoor
and Coopachitty-pollum, where the troops arrived a few
hours after Tippoo had left it. Some elephants, bullocks,
and camels loaded with rockets, fell into the hands of
the British.</p>

<p>On the 4th of October the army arrived at Errode,
the enemy keeping a respectful distance during the
march; and on the 6th of that month it was ascertained
that he had arrived with his whole force at <em>Darraporam</em>,
against which he opened his batteries on the 8th. The
fort had no cannon mounted, and the garrison, consisting
of a hundred Europeans and two hundred sepoys, capitulated
on honorable terms, to which the enemy strictly
adhered.</p>

<p>The British army moved on the 5th of October, and
on the 15th encamped in the neighbourhood of Coimbatore,
where Lieut.-Colonel Stuart joined from <em>Palghautcherry</em>,
after having taken the place, and left it in
a tolerable state of defence. On the 20th of October,
all the heavy baggage having been deposited in the
fort of Coimbatore, the army recommenced moving,
directing its march towards Errode, by Avinochy and
Perentore, where it arrived on the 2d of November.
On the 8th the army proceeded in the direction of
Bovaneore, and thence to a ford about three miles
below Errode, the whole crossing the Cavery on the 9th
and 10th, while Tippoo marched with his entire force
to attack a division under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel
Hamilton Maxwell, of the Seventy-fourth Regiment,
then in the Bharamahl country. On the 11th of
November the army moved by Sankerrydroog for the
Tappoor Pass, and ascended on the 14th, encamping at
Adamancottah, in the Bharamahl country; marched
again on the 15th, and on the 17th effected a junction
with Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell at Darrampoury. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
officer had under his orders the Seventy-fourth and
Seventy-sixth King’s regiments, the fourth battalion of
Madras Europeans, the third, seventh, thirteenth, fourteenth,
twenty-first, twenty-sixth, and twenty-seventh
Bengal sepoys.</p>

<p>The Seventy-fourth joined the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> and
Seventy-second Regiments in the second brigade; and
Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell assumed the command of the
left wing in the place of Colonel Brydges, who was
appointed to command at Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>On the 18th of November the army moved by Coveriporum
to the Tappoor Pass, when the advance fell in
with the rear of Tippoo’s force, but could make no
impression.</p>

<p>It was now ascertained that the enemy, whose movements
were always sudden, varied, and perplexing, was
directing his course to the Carnatic by Namacul and
Trichinopoly. The British in consequence pursued
by Malusundrum, arriving on the 23d at Vavoor; the
27th at Jaloor; on the 6th of December at Munsarapett;
and at Terany on the 31st of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791.</div>

<p>On the 1st of January 1791 the army arrived at
Terrimungulum, and on the 12th at Arnee.</p>

<p>During this long and fatiguing march, the Anglo-Indian
troops frequently encamped upon the ground
from which the enemy had removed in the morning,
but the efforts made to overtake him were not successful.
The sick and heavy guns having been placed
in the fort of Arnee, on the 14th of January the advance
and right wing marched for Velhout, where they arrived
on the 27th, followed by the left wing.</p>

<p>On the 29th of January the army was reviewed by
General Charles the Earl Cornwallis, K.G., who had
arrived from Bengal to assume the command, and who
expressed great satisfaction at the appearance of the
troops. His lordship was at this period Governor-General
and Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and had quitted Bengal on the 6th of December of the
previous year, and landed at Fort St. George, Madras,
on the 30th of the same month.</p>

<p>In the course of the foregoing campaign the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
Regiment lost few men in action, but many fell
victims to climate and fatigue.</p>

<p>The army, being refreshed and equipped, commenced
moving in a westerly direction on the 5th of February,
by Perambaukum and Sholingur, arriving on the 11th in
the vicinity of Vellore. The troops were ordered into
the fort, and on the 14th they marched to Chittipet,
turning suddenly to the right by Chittoor towards the
Muglee Pass, where they arrived on the 17th of February.
On the 18th the advance, followed by the park
and stores, ascended the ghauts, the whole army encamping
on the day following at Palamnaire, in the
Mysore country, without having seen anything of the
enemy.</p>

<p>During the time the British army remained at
Velhout, Tippoo pushed to the southward, and summoned
Cuddalore, but upon learning in what direction Earl
Cornwallis had moved, the Sultan hastened to the
Shangana Pass, where he arrived too late to oppose
the troops at the Muglee Pass. On the 24th, the
British marched for Colar, which was abandoned on
their approach; from thence the army moved to
Ouscotta, which place was immediately carried by a
battalion of sepoys.</p>

<p>The enemy displayed a part of his force on the 4th
of March, and on the following day opened a cannonade
upon the troops moving towards <em>Bangalore</em>, whilst his
horse attempted to attack the stores and baggage, but
without success. About sunset on the 5th of March,
the army encamped within shot of the fort of Bangalore,
and shifted its ground on the day following. The
pettah (the suburbs of the town) was then attacked by
the thirty-sixth and seventy-sixth regiments, with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
battalions of sepoys, and carried, after a very resolute
resistance on the part of the defenders.</p>

<p>From this period to the 14th of March, nothing material
occurred, but every preparation for the approaching
siege was carried on with diligence and activity. On
the 15th, the batteries being completed, opened a fire
upon Bangalore; and on the 17th the lines were cannonaded
by the enemy, while at night the camp was
much disturbed by his rockets.</p>

<p>Forage became very scarce, and none could be procured
beyond the advanced piquets. The siege, however,
proceeded, and the enemy continued to harass the
British until the 21st March, when the breach being
considered practicable, an attack was ordered.</p>

<p>The storming party consisted of the grenadiers of the
thirty-sixth, fifty-second, <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, seventy-second,
seventy-fourth, and seventy-sixth regiments,
followed by their respective light companies, and led by
Lieutenant James Duncan of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and
Lieutenant John Evans of the fifty-second, with a
forlorn hope of thirty chosen men; the whole supported
by the battalion companies of the thirty-sixth,
seventy-second, and seventy-sixth, with some battalions
of Bengal sepoys. The corps of attack were commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell of the seventy-fourth;
the flankers immediately by Major Skelly;
Major-General Medows was present on the occasion.</p>

<p>The grenadier company of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was
commanded by Captain the Honorable John Lindsay,
who, upon entering the breach, directed his men to
throw away their priming, and trust entirely to their
bayonets. The light company was commanded by Captain
James Robertson, son of the celebrated historian.</p>

<p>With the aid of scaling ladders, and after encountering
very formidable obstacles, <em>Bangalore</em> was carried.
From the 6th of March to the conquest of Bangalore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had six privates killed, and fourteen
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 28th of March, a strong garrison being left
in Bangalore, the army moved to Deonhully, the birthplace
of Hyder Ali, where it arrived on the 30th, and
on the 1st of April at Chinnaballaporam, both of which
places were abandoned by the enemy. The army reached
Connapelly on the 12th of April, and on the following
day effected a junction with the Nizam’s force, which
had been sent to co-operate with the British, and which
amounted to about fifteen thousand cavalry.</p>

<p>The army arrived at Venkatagherry, on the 18th of
April, where a large detachment of Europeans, under
Colonel Oldham, joined from the Carnatic, and on the
22d of April again encamped near Bangalore. During
this march, the object of which was chiefly to procure
supplies, the enemy’s irregular horse were now and then
seen in small detached bodies.</p>

<p>The British commenced their march on the 4th of
May towards <em>Seringapatam</em>, the capital of Tippoo Saib’s
territory, and on the 13th of that month arrived at
Arakerry, on the Cavery, about eight miles below
Seringapatam, which derived its name from the god
<em>Serung</em>, to whom one of the pagodas was dedicated.
The enemy was discernible in front, with his right
resting on the river, and his left on a high hill named
the Carighaut.</p>

<p>During the night of the 14th of May the troops
marched with a view to surprise the enemy, but owing
to the badness of the weather and roads, together
with the jaded state of the gun-bullocks, little or
no progress was made during the night; but on the
following day, after having undergone great fatigue,
they were brought into action, when the enemy was
driven from his strong position, and forced across the
river into the island upon which the capital, Seringapatam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
is situated, where he was protected by his
batteries.</p>

<p>In this affair four guns and several standards were
taken. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Lieutenant and
Adjutant Roderick Mackenzie and seven rank and
file killed; Ensign John Stuart and seventy-four rank
and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The army rested upon the field of battle, and was
again in movement on the 18th of May, and arrived
on the 20th at Canambaddy, situated on the Cavery,
some miles above Seringapatam. It was now ascertained
that the season was too far advanced for undertaking
immediately the siege of Tippoo’s capital, and it
was determined accordingly to withdraw. The battering
train was destroyed; all the ammunition and stores
were buried, which could not be removed, and on the
26th of May the army marched in the direction of
Bangalore.</p>

<p>Before commencing their retreat, the soldiers were
thanked in orders for their conduct throughout these
services; and it was added:&mdash;“So long as there were
any hopes of reducing <em>Seringapatam</em> before the commencement
of the heavy rains, the Commander-in-chief
thought himself happy in availing himself of
their willing services; but the unexpected bad
weather, for some time experienced, having rendered
the attack of the enemy’s capital impracticable, until
the conclusion of the ensuing monsoons, Lord Cornwallis
thought he should make an ill return for the
zeal and alacrity exhibited by the soldiers, if he
desired them to draw the guns and stores back to a
magazine, where there remains an ample supply of
both, which was captured by their valour; he did not,
therefore, hesitate to order the guns and stores which
were not wanted for field service to be destroyed.”</p>

<p>In the course of this retreat the British were joined
by the Mahratta army, under Hurry Punt and Purseram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Bhow, consisting of about thirty-two thousand men,
chiefly cavalry, and thirty pieces of cannon. Of the
approach of this large force, the British had been kept
in total ignorance, by the active manner in which the
communications were interrupted by Tippoo’s irregular
troops. Captain Little, having under his orders two
battalions of Bombay sepoys, joined with the Mahratta
army, and the supplies were now abundant.</p>

<p>On the 11th of July, after marching by Alcotta,
Goodyanelly, Outredroog, and Sankerrydroog, the
army arrived at Bangalore.</p>

<p>The enemy made no attempt whatever to interrupt
the march. By this time the Nizam’s cavalry had
become unfit to keep the field, and were allowed to
return to their own country. Purseram Bhow also,
with a large detachment of the Mahrattas, proceeded
into the Sera country; but Hurry Punt, with the
remainder, continued attached to the British army.
On the 15th of July the whole of the sick, and one half
of the tumbrils belonging to the field-pieces, were sent
into the fort of Bangalore, and the army moved towards
Oussoor, where it arrived on the 11th of the following
month.</p>

<p>The fort of Oussoor was abandoned by the enemy,
after he had blown up the angles. In this place
were found the bodies of three Europeans who had
been put to death by Tippoo’s orders. One of these
unfortunate persons, named Hamilton, had been an
officer in the British navy.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August the army moved from
Oussoor, and on the 23d arrived at Bayeur. About
this period Major Gowdie, of the Honorable East India
Company’s Service, was detached with some troops
for the reduction of the strong hill fort of <em>Nundydroog</em>,
which it was found required regular approaches.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the thirty-sixth and <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiments, under the command of Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Robertson, of the latter corps, marched on the 17th of
October to join the detachment under Major Gowdie,
and, upon their arrival, were immediately placed in the
last parallel.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October, General the Earl Cornwallis,
with the whole army, made a movement towards <em>Nundydroog</em>,
and in the evening of that day the troops were
told off for an assault upon the two breaches, which
had been pronounced practicable. The attacks commenced
at eleven o’clock at night, the grenadiers
assaulting the right breach, and the light companies
the left. The forlorn hope of the right attack consisted
of twenty grenadiers, volunteers from the thirty-sixth
and <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, led by Lieutenant Hugh
Mackenzie of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, formerly paymaster
of the regiment. The same number of light infantry,
headed by Lieutenant Lewis Moore, of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
formed the left attack. The grenadier company
of the regiment, in support, was commanded by
Lieutenant James Duncan; the light company, by
Lieutenant Kenneth Mackenzie; the whole under
Captain Robertson’s orders, as before stated.</p>

<p>Captain Robert Burne supported, with the thirty-sixth
grenadiers, the right attack, and Captain William
Hartley, with the light company of that regiment, the
left attack; Major-General Medows, as usual, animating
the whole with his presence.</p>

<p>Both breaches were carried without much resistance
from the enemy, and the gateway of the inner wall
being soon secured, the fort fell into the possession of
the British. Many of the enemy were killed, and
several, in attempting to escape, were dashed to pieces
over the precipices. It was an additional source of
gratification, that this important service had been
achieved without the loss of a British soldier.</p>

<p>In a few days subsequently to the fall of Nundydroog,
the army retraced its route to Bangalore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 4th of December the troops were again put
in movement, directing their march towards <em>Savendroog</em>,
a fortress situated on the side of a mountain,
environed by almost inaccessible rocks. The fort being
reconnoitred, a detachment under Lieut.-Colonel James
Stuart, of the Seventy-second regiment, was selected,
and ordered to reduce the place. On the 17th the
British were enabled to open upon the fort a battery
of six eighteen-pounders and three twelve-pounders,
with considerable effect.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> and
seventy-sixth regiments joined the detachment under
Lieut.-Colonel Stuart on the 20th of December, and on
the following day the flank companies of the fifty-second,
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, seventy-second, and seventy-sixth,
were selected for the attack upon <em>Savendroog</em> (in
which a practicable breach had been effected), and
formed under Lieut.-Colonel Colebrook Nesbitt, of the
fifty-second regiment.</p>

<p>The storming party, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Nesbitt, was directed to four different attacks. Captain
James Gage, with the grenadiers of the fifty-second
and flank companies of the seventy-sixth regiment, to
gain the eastern hill to the left; Captain the Honorable
William Monson, with the light company of the fifty-second,
to scour the works towards the western hill on
the right; Captain the Honorable John Lindsay and
Captain James Robertson, with the flank companies
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, to separate, and attack the
works or parties they might discover in the chasm or
hollow between the hills; the fifty-second and seventy-second
regiments were to follow the flank companies;
parties were detached under Lieut.-Colonel Baird and
Major Petrie round the mountain, to draw the attention
of the enemy from the main object, and to endeavour
to prevent his escape.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock in the morning of the 21st of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
December, on a signal of two guns being fired from the
batteries, the flank companies, in the order described,
followed by the fifty-second and seventy-second regiments,
advanced to the assault; the band of the
fifty-second playing “<em>Britons, strike home!</em>” while the
grenadiers and light infantry mounted the breach.</p>

<p>Immediate success followed the attempt, the fort
being carried without the loss of a man. The troops
were thanked in general orders for their gallant conduct,
in which it was stated,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Cornwallis thinks himself fortunate, almost
beyond example, in having acquired by assault a
fortress of so much strength and reputation, and of
such inestimable value to the public interest, as
Savendroog,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> without having to regret the loss of a
single soldier.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of a short time afterwards, the following
places surrendered, with trifling loss, to detachments
of the British army; namely, Outredroog, Ram Gurry,
and Sheria Gurry.</p>

<p>The army subsequently moved towards Outredroog,
a hill fort about thirty miles west of Bangalore, where
a general hospital was established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792.</div>

<p>On the 31st of January 1792 the army under
General the Earl Cornwallis was reviewed by the
Poonah and Hyderabad chiefs, and on the following
day commenced its march towards <em>Seringapatam</em>, passing
by Hooleadroog, Tajilly, and Carrycode. The troops
came in sight of Tippoo’s capital on the 5th of February,
and encamped at the French Rocks. The enemy’s
horse showed itself on the 4th and 5th, but attempted
nothing hostile.</p>

<p>The entrenched camp of Tippoo was reconnoitred on
the 6th of February, and at dark the army was formed
in three columns of attack. The right, under Major
General Medows, consisting of the thirty-sixth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
seventy-sixth King’s regiments. The centre, under
the Commander-in-chief, General the Earl Cornwallis,
consisting of the fifty-second, <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and
seventy-fourth King’s regiments. The left, under
Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell of the seventy-fourth, was
composed of the seventy-second regiment. The native
troops were divided among the three columns.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock in the evening of the 6th of February
the three columns were in motion. The head of the
centre column, led by the flank companies of the respective
corps, after twice crossing the Lokany river, which
covered the enemy’s right wing and front, came in contact
with his first line, and immediately forced through
it. The British flankers, mixing with the fugitives,
crossed the north branch of the Cavery, at the foot
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glacis</i> of the fort of <em>Seringapatam</em>. Captain the
Honorable John Lindsay collected the grenadiers of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glacis</i>, and attempted to push
into the body of the place, but was prevented by the
bridge being raised a few moments before he reached
it. He was soon after joined by some of the light
company of the fifty-second and grenadiers of the
seventy-sixth, with whom he forced his way down to
the famous <em>Llal Baugh</em>, or “<em>Garden of Pearls</em>,” where
he was attacked most furiously, but the enemy was
repelled in a very spirited style with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Captain Lindsay was afterwards joined by the
seventy-fourth grenadiers, and attempted to drive the
enemy from the Pettah, but could not succeed, from
the numbers which poured on him from all sides. This
gallant officer then took post in a redoubt, where he
maintained himself until morning, and then moved to
the north bank of the river, where the firing appeared
very heavy. He was there met by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel
the Honorable John Knox, of the thirty-sixth
regiment, and by Lieut.-Colonel Baird, with the
grenadiers of the fifty-second, and the light company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, together with some of the
troops that composed the left attack.</p>

<p>During these occurrences the battalion companies of
the fifty-second, <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and seventy-second
regiments forced their way across the river to the
island, overpowering all that opposed them, when
Captain Archdeacon, commanding a battalion of Bengal
Sepoys, being killed, that battalion was thrown into
confusion, falling back upon the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>.
Major Stair Park Dalrymple, wishing to prevent the
Sepoys intermingling with his men, ordered the regiment
to oblique to the left, an operation that by chance
brought him in contact with the Sultan’s redoubt,
which was instantly attacked and carried. The charge
of the redoubt was given to Captain Hugh Sibbald,
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, with his company, who on the
following morning was killed, nobly defending it against
repeated and desperate attacks from the enemy. The
commander-in-chief, General the Earl Cornwallis, in
compliment to the memory of this officer, had the name
of the redoubt changed to “Sibbald.”</p>

<p>In the evening of the 7th of February three thousand
of the enemy’s horse attacked the British troops on the
island, but were repulsed by the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment and the first Coast Sepoys. In the course
of these operations the regiment had Captain Sibbald
and Lieutenant Daniel Bayne killed; Ensign Duncan
Mackenzie was wounded; about one hundred rank and
file were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy’s loss was very severe, being estimated
at 20,000 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors-de-combat</i>. Eighty pieces of cannon were
taken by the British.</p>

<p>On the 9th of February the army took up its final
position for the siege of <em>Seringapatam</em>, and on the
15th Major-General Robert Abercromby joined with
the Bombay force, consisting of the seventy-third,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
seventy-fifth, and seventy-seventh regiments, besides
native troops, making a total of about 6,000 men.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, commanded by Major
Dalrymple, crossed the south branch of the Cavery at
nine o’clock at night on the 18th of February, and in
two hours after attacked by surprise a camp of the
enemy’s cavalry, of whom great part were slain, and
the remainder dispersed in all directions. This movement
was designed to cover the operation of opening
the trenches, which took place at the same time, within
eight hundred yards of the fort.</p>

<p>Until the 24th of February the approaches were
carried on with the greatest activity, when the general
orders announced that the preliminary articles of peace
had been signed, and in consequence all hostile measures
immediately ceased.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February the two sons of Tippoo
Saib, Abdel Kalek and Mooza-ud-Deen, the former ten
years of age, and the latter eight, were brought to the
British camp, as hostages for the due performance of the
preliminary articles.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of some obstacles which had been
opposed by Tippoo to the arrangement of the definitive
treaty, working parties were ordered, and the guns replaced
in the batteries on the 10th March. This state
of suspicion and preparation lasted until the 15th of
March, when it was discontinued, and on the 18th of
that month, the definitive treaty being duly executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and signed, was delivered by the young Abdel Kalek
to each of the confederates. On the 20th the counterpart
was sent off to Tippoo Saib.</p>

For Cannon’s Military Records.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus terminated a war in which the confederates
wrested from the enemy seventy fortresses, eight
hundred pieces of cannon, and destroyed or dispersed at
least fifty thousand men. By the articles of the treaty,
Tippoo was bound to pay a large sum of money, and to
cede one half of his dominions.</p>

<p>The Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in
India granted from this money a sum equal to six
months’ batta for all ranks, and the Court of Directors
afterwards made a similar grant.</p>

<p>On the 26th of March, the exchange of the definitive
treaty being completed, the British commenced moving
towards Bangalore, from whence they proceeded to the
Pednaigdurgum Pass, where the Bengal troops were
ordered to their own presidency.</p>

<p>Early in May the army descended the Ghauts,
arriving soon after at Vellore, where the Commander-in-Chief
arranged the cantonments of the troops, and
proceeded to Madras. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> received
orders to march to the southward, and in the month of
June arrived at Warriore, near Trichinopoly, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Baird, who during the
campaign had been absent from the regiment in command
of a brigade. Eight companies were stationed
at Warriore, and two were detached with Major
Dalrymple to Dindigul. In this situation the regiment
continued for the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793.</div>

<p>In March 1793, the eight companies under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Baird proceeded from Warriore
to Secundermally, in the neighbourhood of Madura.
Meanwhile the events of the French revolution had
involved England in another contest, the National Convention
of France having declared war against Great
Britain and Holland, in February 1793. The news of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
this event arrived in India in May following, when the
siege of the French settlement of <em>Pondicherry</em>, on the
Coromandel coast, was determined upon. Lieut.-Colonel
Baird, of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, was appointed
to command a brigade on this service.</p>

<p>In July the flank companies of the regiment were
ordered to join the force about to besiege <em>Pondicherry</em>,
and marched for that purpose, being followed soon
afterwards by the battalion companies. The place surrendered
on the 22d of August, and the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
returned to Secundermally and Dindigul, where
the regiment continued during the remainder of the
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794.</div>

<p>An attack upon the Mauritius was in contemplation
at the commencement of the year 1794, and troops for
that service were assembled at Wallajohabad. The
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, having received orders to join this
force, marched to Wallajohabad, where the regiment
remained only a short time, having been ordered to
return to the southward, in consequence of the projected
expedition being relinquished.</p>

<p>The regiment marched accordingly, and arrived at
Tanjore in June, where it was stationed for the remainder
of the year, having two companies detached,
under Major Dalrymple, at Vellum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795.</div>

<p>Holland became united to France in the early part of
1795, and was styled the Batavian republic. Upon the
arrival of this information in India, an expedition was
fitted out against the island of <em>Ceylon</em>, where the Dutch
had several settlements. Major Dalrymple, with the flank
companies, marched to the coast, and embarked at
Negapatam, for the purpose of co-operating with the
troops destined for Ceylon, under the command of
Colonel James Stuart, of the seventy-second, who was
promoted to the rank of Major-General at this period.
The fleet arrived on the coast of Ceylon on the 1st of
August, and two days afterwards the troops landed four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
miles north of the fort of <em>Trincomalee</em>. The siege of
the fort was commenced as soon as the artillery and
stores could be landed, and removed sufficiently near to
the place. On the 26th of August a practicable breach
was effected, and the garrison surrendered. The fort of
<em>Batticaloe</em> surrendered on the 18th of September, and
the fort and island of <em>Manaar</em> capitulated on the 5th of
October. After these services were performed, the flank
companies returned to Tanjore in the month of October,
having lost eleven men in killed and wounded.
Captain William Charles Gorrie, of the grenadier company,
was desperately wounded in this expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796.</div>

<p>In May 1796, the regiment marched to Wallajohabad,
where it was stationed during the remainder of
the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797.</div>

<p>On the 2d of January 1797, the regiment was inspected
by Major-General Clarke, who issued the
following general order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Major-General Clarke has experienced infinite satisfaction,
this morning, at the review of His Majesty’s
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment.</p>

<p>“He cannot say that on any occasion of field
exercise he ever was present at a more perfect
performance.</p>

<p>“When a corps is so striking in appearance, and so
complete in every branch of its discipline, little can
occur to the Commander-in-chief to particularize.
He cannot but notice, however, that the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment has excited his admiration for its
expertness in those parts of its exercise which are
most essential, and most difficult to execute. He
alludes to its order and regularity when moving in
line; its extreme accuracy in preserving distances,
and the neatness and promptitude that are so evident
in all its formations. So much perfection in a corps,
whose services in India will long be held in remembrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
does the greatest honor to Lieut.-Colonel
Baird and all his officers, to whom, and the corps at
large, the Commander-in-chief desires to offer his best
thanks.”</p>
</div>

<p>The regiment remained in the cantonment of Wallajohabad
until the month of October, when orders were
issued for its return to Europe. It was accordingly
drafted, giving five hundred men to the seventy-third
and seventy-fourth regiments, and then marched from
Wallajohabad, under the command of Colonel Baird,
with the non-commissioned officers, drummers, and
invalids, to Madras, and immediately embarked on
board of Indiamen for Great Britain. The fleet sailed
from Madras Roads on the 17th of October, and was
at sea during the remainder of the year.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1798.</div>

<p>Early in January 1798, the fleet arrived at the Cape
of Good Hope, where the commanding officer of the
regiment, Colonel Baird, was detained upon the staff,
having been appointed brigadier-general. After remaining
a few days in Table Bay, the fleet sailed, and
reached St. Helena in February, where it was detained
three months waiting for a convoy.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed on the 1st of May from St. Helena,
without a convoy, and in July, in consequence of
contrary winds, was compelled to put into Cork Harbour.
It sailed from thence for the Thames, and on
the 12th of August the regiment disembarked at Woolwich,
where it remained for a few days, and then re-embarked
in smacks for Leith. After landing, the
regiment proceeded to Stirling. As a mark of indulgence,
a general leave for two months was granted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, to enable
them to visit their friends and families, after a long
absence from their native country. At the expiration of
this period, the whole assembled at Stirling, with the
addition of several recruits. Immediately afterwards,
the whole of the officers and non-commissioned officers,
with the exception of the staff, and a few at head-quarters,
were sent out to recruit the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799.</div>

<p>During the year 1799, the head-quarters remained
at Stirling, and the recruiting went on but slowly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800.</div>

<p>In May 1800, the strength of the regiment amounted
to about two hundred rank and file, when a route
arrived changing the quarters to Paisley, but soon
after the march an order arrived for its proceeding to
Ireland. In June the regiment reached Portpatrick,
and crossed immediately to Donaghadee, from whence it
marched, under the command of Colonel Dalrymple, to
Newry, and in a few days afterwards was removed
to Dundalk.</p>

<p>In July the regiment received six hundred volunteers
from the Scotch Fencible corps serving in
Ireland, and remained at Dundalk until the close of
the year, when a route for Dublin was received.
At this period, Colonel Dalrymple was appointed
brigadier-general, and the command of the regiment
devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel John French.</p>

<p>On the 6th of December Major Denis Pack was promoted
from the fourth Royal Irish dragoon guards to
be Lieutenant-Colonel in the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment,
in succession to Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable John
Lindsay, who retired from the service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801.</div>

<p>The regiment, early in the year 1801, marched from
Dundalk to Dublin, and occupied the barracks in the
Palatine Square. On the 24th of April, Lieut.-Colonel
Pack joined, and assumed the command of the
regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1802.</div>

<p>In March 1802, in which month the Peace of
Amiens was concluded, the regiment proceeded from
Dublin, and was cantoned in the county of Wicklow.
The corps was so divided, that at Arklow, the head-quarters,
there were only two companies. In this
situation it continued for the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803.</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded, in March 1803, in three
divisions, to Ballinasloe, where it remained for a few
days, and afterwards marched to Loughrea.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir John Francis Cradock, K.B., was
appointed colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment on
the 6th of August 1803, in succession to General the
Honorable William Gordon, who was removed to the
twenty-first Royal North British Fusiliers.</p>

<p>The regiment continued at Loughrea, but the light
company was detached to Limerick, to join a light
battalion which was being formed at that place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804.</div>

<p>In May the regiment proceeded from Loughrea to
the county of Limerick, the head-quarters being stationed
at Rathkeale; one detachment at Newcastle,
another at Tarbert, and a third at Askeaton.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, war
had recommenced with France, and Bonaparte having
made preparations for invading Great Britain, additional
measures of defence to those of the former year were
adopted by the Government;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and under the “<em>Additional
Force Act</em>,” passed on the 10th of July 1804, a second
battalion was added to the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment,
which was to consist of men to be raised for limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
service in certain counties of North Britain. The
second battalion was formed at Dumbarton in October,
to the command of which Lieut.-Colonel Lord George
Beresford was appointed. Its establishment was fixed
at 23 serjeants, 22 drummers, 20 corporals, and 380
privates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805.<br />
<span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>In March 1805 the first battalion, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Pack, proceeded to Bandon in
the county of Cork, and was stationed at that place
until July, when it marched to Cork, and immediately
afterwards to Monkstown, where it embarked in transports,
having been selected to form part of a secret
expedition under its former commander, Major-General
Sir David Baird.</p>

<p>In the beginning of August the embarkation was
completed, and on the 5th of that month the fleet
sailed, convoyed by three 64-gun ships, two frigates and
gun-brigs, under the orders of Commodore Sir Home
Popham; and on the 28th of September the fleet, after
a very boisterous passage, arrived at Madeira.</p>

<p>On the 3d of October the fleet left Madeira, and on
the 12th of November arrived at St. Salvador, in the
Brazils, where an opportunity was afforded of refreshing
the men, landing the sick, and procuring some horses
for the cavalry.</p>

<p>The fleet again put to sea on the 28th of November,
and directed its course towards the Dutch colony of the
<em>Cape of Good Hope</em>, then in possession of the Batavian
Government, which was united with France in hostility
to Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806.</div>

<p>The fleet arrived at the high table-land of the Cape
of Good Hope on the 4th of January 1806, and shortly
afterwards came to anchor. The whole of the following
day the surf upon the shore of the bay was too violent to
admit of any attempt to land. Brigadier-General William
Carr, afterwards General Viscount, Beresford, was detached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with such of the cavalry as had horses, and the
thirty-eighth regiment, to Saldanha Bay.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the morning of the 6th of January a landing was
effected by the Highland brigade, under the command
of Brigadier-General Ronald Craufurd Ferguson, in
the performance of which service Lieut.-Colonel Pack,
the commanding officer of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment,
was wounded. The following day was devoted to landing
the supplies and the remainder of the army.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 8th of January Major-General
Sir David Baird formed his troops in two
columns, and moved up to the heights of <em>Bleuberg</em>
(Blue Mountain), from whence the enemy was seen,
drawn up in order of battle, in two lines, with twenty-three
pieces of cannon, his numbers being calculated at
5,000, of which a large proportion was cavalry.</p>

<p>The British lines were formed with promptitude and
correctness, and the enemy was attacked with the
utmost spirit. He maintained his ground with some
firmness, until a charge of the Highland brigade dislodged
and completely routed him, with the loss of
three guns and 700 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In this affair the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Robert Campbell wounded. Five men were
killed, and two serjeants and sixty-four rank and file
were wounded.</p>

<p>The troops halted for the night at the Reit Valley,
and on the 9th of January the army moved towards the
Salt River, where it was intended to take up a position
previously to the attack of <em>Cape Town</em>, when a flag of
truce appeared from the town, which produced some
negotiations, that terminated in its surrender to His
Majesty’s arms. Lieut.-General Janssens, the Governor
of the colony, after his defeat at Bleuberg on the 8th,
had retired towards the interior of the country by the
Hottentot Holland Kloof, or Pass, from whence, on
the 19th of January, he signed and ratified the treaty
that placed the whole of the Cape of Good Hope and
its dependencies in the possession of Great Britain,
under whose sway it has since continued.</p>

<p>The Royal authority was subsequently granted for the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> to bear the words “<span class="smcap">Cape of Good
Hope</span>” on the regimental colour and appointments, to
commemorate its distinguished gallantry at the capture
of that important colony.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>As the following letter from Brigadier General
Ferguson to Major-General Sir David Baird is very
creditable to the regiment and to its commander, it is
here inserted.</p>

<p>“As in the affair of Bleuberg, on the 8th instant,
chance placed two of the enemy’s guns in possession of
the Highland brigade, I hope you will be pleased to
order the allowance usually granted on such occasions
to be issued, and shared amongst the 71st, 72d, and
93d regiments.</p>

<p>“Although the guns fell into our hands in front of
the 71st regiment, Lieut.-Colonel Pack (desirous that
the three regiments should be considered as one
family) has most handsomely withdrawn the prior
claim His Majesty’s 71st regiment might have made,
and to which the situation of the guns, when taken,
would have entitled that most excellent corps.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> went into quarters at the cantonment
of Wynberg, about seven miles from Cape Town,
on the road to Simon’s Bay, where the battalion remained
until the 12th of April, when, most unexpectedly,
an order arrived for its immediate embarkation on
an expedition to the Rio de la Plata in South America,
which had been planned by the British commanders,
naval and military, at the Cape. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
was the only corps of the Cape garrison destined for
this service, with the addition of a few dragoons and
some artillery. At this period the strength of the battalion
amounted to eight hundred rank and file, having
received some recruits from foreign corps at the Cape.
The troops were to be commanded by Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
William Carr Beresford, afterwards General Viscount
Beresford.</p>

<p>The battalion was embarked in line-of-battle ships
and in transports, and on the 14th of April the fleet
sailed from Table Bay, directing its course to the westward
until the 20th, when, in consequence of unfavourable
weather, and having parted company with one of
the transports, in which were three companies of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, the signal was made to rendezvous at
St. Helena, at which island the fleet arrived on the 30th
of April, with the exception of the missing transport.
Here the force under Brigadier-General Beresford received
an augmentation of two hundred men from the
St. Helena regiment, making a total of a thousand and
eighty-seven rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May the fleet sailed from St. Helena,
and after a tedious voyage arrived at Cape St. Mary’s,
at the entrance of the Rio de la Plata, on the 8th of
June, where it met with the missing transport.</p>

<p>The troops that had sailed in the line-of-battle ships
were transferred on the 16th of June to the transports,
which proceeded up the river, and on the 24th of that
month came to anchor opposite the city of <em>Buenos
Ayres</em>. On the 25th, at night, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
with the other troops, effected a landing without any
opposition. The following morning they pushed forward,
and met the enemy at the village of Reduction, who
made a trifling stand, and then retired towards the city.
On this occasion Captain Henry Le Blanc of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> lost his leg, and a serjeant and five
rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The British troops continued to advance in pursuit
of the enemy, and on the morning of the 27th of June
forced their passage across the Chualo. Some skirmishing
followed this movement, but the city of <em>Buenos
Ayres</em> almost immediately surrendered. In the evening
the town and fort were taken possession of by the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> and detachments of
Marines and St. Helena Regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> occupied barracks in Buenos
Ayres, and remained undisturbed until the beginning of
August, by which time the enemy had collected a force
of about 1,500 men, under a leader named Pueridon, at
five leagues from the city. Brigadier-General Beresford,
in consequence, moved out with three hundred of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, fifty from the St. Helena Regiment,
and six field pieces; attacked and dispersed the enemy,
taking all his artillery, namely, ten pieces of various
calibre. The battalion had only five men wounded in
this operation.</p>

<p>About this period, a body of the enemy, headed by
Colonel Liniers, a French officer in the service of Spain,
crossed from Colonna to Concher, evidently with hostile
intentions. Forming a junction with the force under
Pueridon, the whole marched upon Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August the enemy commenced operations,
by the massacre of a serjeant and his guard of
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> Regiment, who were posted at a
place in the suburbs where the bull-fights were usually
exhibited. On the following day much skirmishing
ensued in the outskirts of the city, the enemy taking
possession of the tops of houses, from which he kept up
a galling and destructive fire.</p>

<p>During this time the main body of the British force
took up a position in the Grand Square, but afterwards
retired into the fort of Buenos Ayres. Being now
bereft of all resources, and without hopes of reinforcement,
there appeared no alternative but to capitulate,
and about one o’clock on the 12th of August hostilities
ceased, and the fort was surrendered. The troops
marched out with the honors of war, and laid down
their arms in the Square.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were now prisoners; the officers
were allowed their parole, and quartered upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
inhabitants; the men were confined in the prisons of the
city.</p>

<p>In these melancholy proceedings fell Lieutenant
William Mitchell and Ensign Thomas Lucas. Both had
much distinguished themselves. The battalion lost in
killed and wounded ninety-one men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>In August 1806 the second battalion embarked at
Glasgow for Ireland, and arrived at Belfast on the 1st
of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>About the middle of September, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
were removed from Buenos Ayres into the interior. Brigadier-General
Beresford, with his staff, and Lieut.-Colonel
Pack, were placed at Luxon, from whence they
subsequently effected their escape, upon learning that
the removal of the prisoners still further up the country
had been ordered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Pack was thus enabled to join the
troops which had landed near Monte Video in January
1807, under the command of Brigadier-General Sir
Samuel Auchmuty, and to afford assistance in the important
operations then being carried on. Sir Samuel
Auchmuty, at Lieut.-Colonel Pack’s request, directed
a board of naval and military officers to inquire into the
particulars of his escape, by whom it was unanimously
approved, and he was declared free to serve.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>The second battalion was removed from Ireland to
Scotland in January 1807, but returned to Ireland in
June following.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>In May 1807, a further removal to the interior of the
prisoners took place. The officers were collected at a
college belonging to the Jesuits, about forty leagues to
the northward of Cordova, and entirely separated from
their men. In this situation they remained until August
following, when, just as they were ordered to prepare
for a transfer to a station still more remote, the accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the convention entered into by Lieut.-General John
Whitelocke were received, by which it was stipulated
that the prisoners should be restored to liberty, on
condition that all the British forces should be withdrawn.
It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the
prospect of being restored to liberty and friends was
greatly damped by the military events which produced
it, and which completely extinguished the ardent hopes
of success that had been entertained from the arrival of
the last British force in South America.</p>

<p>In September the whole of the officers and men were
re-conducted to Buenos Ayres, from whence they were
conveyed in boats to Monte Video, and there embarked
in transports, with a view of returning to Europe.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance highly creditable to the character
of the soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, that although
so many and powerful allurements were held out to
induce them to remain in South America, still not
more than thirty-six individuals were found to swerve
from their duty and allegiance to their king and
country.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed immediately, and after a tedious and
rough voyage of three months the transports having
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> on board put into Cork Harbour
in December, and on the 27th of that month the whole
were landed, without uniform, clothing, arms, or accoutrements,
and marched to Middleton, under the command
of Major Henry Tolley, Lieut.-Colonel Pack
having previously returned to England from South
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>

<p>In March 1808, the regiment proceeded from Middleton
to Cork, where its equipment in every respect
was completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>The second battalion embarked at Londonderry for
Scotland on the 9th of April 1808, after transferring
200 men to the first battalion, which raised the strength
of the latter to nearly 900 rank and file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>On the 26th of April, whilst in garrison at Cork,
new colours, to replace those left in South America,
were presented to the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> by Lieut.-General
John Floyd, who had commanded the cavalry
and advance in the campaign of 1790 in the East
Indies.</p>

<p>The following animating and soldierlike address was
made by the gallant general on the occasion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad4">“<span class="smcap">Seventy-first!!</span></p>

<p>“I am directed to perform the honorable duty of
presenting your colours.</p>

<p>“Brave <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, the world is well acquainted
with your gallant conduct at the capture of <em>Buenos
Ayres</em>, in South America, under one of His Majesty’s
bravest generals.</p>

<p>“It is well known that you defended your conquest
with the utmost courage, good conduct, and discipline
to the last extremity. When diminished to a handful,
hopeless of succour, and destitute of provisions, you
were overwhelmed by multitudes, and reduced by the
fortune of war to lose your liberty, and your well-defended
colours, but not your honor. Your honor,
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, remains unsullied. Your
last act in the field covered you with glory. Your
generous despair, calling upon your general to suffer
you to die with arms in your hands, proceeded from
the genuine spirit of British soldiers. Your behavior
in prosperity,&mdash;your sufferings in captivity,&mdash;and
your faithful discharge of your duty to your
King and country, are appreciated by all.</p>

<p>“You who now stand on this parade, in defiance of
the allurements held out to base desertion, are endeared
to the army and to the country, and your
conduct will ensure you the esteem of all true soldiers,&mdash;of
all worthy men,&mdash;and fill every one of you with
honest martial pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“It has been my good fortune to have witnessed, in
a remote part of the world, the early glories and
gallant conduct of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment in
the field; and it is with great satisfaction I meet you
again, with replenished ranks, with good arms in your
hands, and with stout hearts in your bosoms.</p>

<p>“Look forward, officers and soldiers, to the achievement
of new honors and the acquirement of fresh
fame!!</p>

<p>“Officers! be the friends and guardians of these
brave fellows committed to your charge!!</p>

<p>“Soldiers! give your confidence to your officers.
They have shared with you the chances of war; they
have bravely bled along with you;&mdash;they will always
do honor to themselves and you. Preserve your
regiment’s reputation for valour in the field and regularity
in quarters.</p>

<p>“I have now the honor to present the</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Royal colour</span>.<br />
“This is the <span class="smcap">King’s colour</span>!!</p>

<p>“I have now the honor to present your <span class="smcap">Regimental
colour</span>.</p>

<p>“This is the colour of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment.</p>

<p>“May victory for ever crown these colours!!!”</p></div>

<p>The Peninsula was at this period the centre of political
interest. Portugal, deserted by her government,
and Spain betrayed, the people of each rose in arms to
recover the national independence. Dissensions had
arisen in the royal family of Spain, occasioned by the
sway of Emanuel Godoy, who bore the title of Prince
of Peace. This minister was dismissed, but the court
was unable to restore tranquillity. In this emergency,
the French emperor was solicited to be umpire, and
Napoleon ultimately placed the crown of Spain on his
brother Joseph, who was transferred from the throne
of Naples. The Spaniards flew to arms in consequence.
The British government resolved to aid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Spanish and Portuguese patriots, and a British army
was ordered to proceed to the Peninsula, under the command
of Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. The
first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment formed
part of the force selected on this occasion.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment
embarked at the Cove of Cork on the 17th of June
1808. Its strength consisted of fifty-two serjeants,
twenty-two drummers, and eight hundred and seventy-four
rank and file.</p>

<p>In June 1808 His Majesty King George III. was
pleased to approve of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> bearing the
title of <em>Glasgow</em> regiment, in addition to the appellation
of <em>Highland</em> regiment.</p>

<p>In the first instance, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were
brigaded with the fifth, thirty-eighth, and fifth battalion
of the sixtieth regiment, under Brigadier-General
Henry Fane, and sailed for Portugal, in conjunction
with the forces destined to aid the Spaniards and
Portuguese, on the 12th of July. After a favourable
passage, the troops anchored in Mondego Bay in the
beginning of August, and a landing was effected in the
vicinity of the village of Frejus.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 4th of August a small
piquet of the enemy stationed in the neighbourhood
fell back, and the operation of disembarking the troops
was carried into effect without opposition. The army
then moved on to a position across a deep sandy
country, where it halted, and encamped for the night.</p>

<p>At this period a change took place in the arrangement
of the brigades, and the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was placed, with the thirty-sixth and
fortieth regiments, in that commanded by Major-General
Ronald Craufurd Ferguson.</p>

<p>The division under Major-General Sir Brent Spencer,
K.B., from Cadiz, consisting of about four thousand
men, joined on the 8th of August; and, after a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
halt, the army was again put in motion to occupy a
more forward position, where it remained for some
days. On the 17th of August the enemy, commanded
by General Laborde, was encountered near
<em>Roleia</em>. The position was attacked, and carried with
great loss to the French, who retreated on Torres
Vedras.</p>

<p>The light company of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was the
only part of the regiment engaged, the remainder being
employed in manœuvring on the right flank of the
French. The light company suffered a trifling loss,
having but one man killed and a few wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> subsequently received the royal
authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Roleia</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of
this victory.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, after the battle
of Roleia, did not pursue the enemy by the high roads,
but keeping to the right near the sea, marched to
<em>Vimiera</em>, to cover the landing of a brigade commanded
by Major-General Anstruther, which was effected on
the 20th of August.</p>

<p>The morning of the 21st of August was given up to
the troops, in order to prepare and repose themselves.
The men were engaged in washing and cleaning their
equipments, when the approach of the enemy, moving
to the left, was discovered at eight o’clock in the
morning, and the brigades commanded by Major-General
Ferguson, Brigadier-Generals Nightingall,
Acland, and Bowes, were consequently moved across
a valley from the heights on the west to those on the
east of Vimiera.</p>

<p>Marshal Junot, Duke of Abrantes, moved on his
army to the attack of the position, and commenced it
on the British centre, where the fiftieth regiment was
posted, moving along the front gradually to the left,
until the whole line became engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time previously to this, the soldiers of the
brigade were ordered to sit down, with their arms in
their hands, keeping their formation. The enemy in
the meantime cannonaded the whole line, and pushed
on his sharpshooters and infantry. To oppose the
former, Major-General Ferguson ordered the left sections
of companies to move forward and skirmish.
Upon the retreat of the enemy’s sharpshooters, the
action became general along the front of this brigade, and
the whole moved forward to the attack. Nothing could
surpass the steadiness of the troops on this occasion,
and the general and commanding officer set a noble
example, which was followed by all.</p>

<p>The grenadier company of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
greatly distinguished itself, in conjunction with a subdivision
of the light company of the thirty-sixth regiment.
Captain Alexander Forbes, who commanded
the grenadier company, was ordered to the support
of some British artillery, and, seizing a favorable
opportunity, made a dash at a battery of the enemy’s
artillery immediately in his front. He succeeded in
capturing five guns and a howitzer, with horses,
caissons, and equipment complete. In this affair alone
the grenadier company had Lieutenants John Pratt
and Ralph Dudgeon and thirteen rank and file wounded,
together with two men killed.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The French made a daring effort to retake their
artillery, both with cavalry and infantry; but the
gallant conduct of the grenadier company, and the advance
of Major-General Ferguson’s brigade, finally left
the guns in the possession of those who had so gallantly
captured them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>George Clark, one of the pipers of the regiment,
and afterwards piper to the Highland Society of
London, was wounded in this action, and being unable
to accompany his corps in the advance against the
enemy, put his pipes in order, and struck up a favourite
regimental air, to the great delight of his comrades.
This is the second instance in which the pipers of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> have behaved with particular gallantry,
and evinced high feeling for the credit and honor of
the corps.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>During the advance of the battalion, several prisoners
were taken, among whom was the French general,
Brennier. Corporal John M<sup>c</sup>Kay, of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
who took him, was afterwards promoted to an
ensigncy in the Fourth West India Regiment.</p>

<p>The result of this battle was the total defeat of the
enemy, who subsequently retreated on Lisbon, with
the loss of twenty-one pieces of cannon, twenty-three
ammunition waggons, with powder, shells, stores of all
descriptions, and 20,000 rounds of musket ammunition,
together with a great many officers and soldiers killed,
wounded, and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The conduct of the battalion, and of its commanding
officer, Lieut.-Colonel Pack, was noticed in the public
despatches, and the thanks of both Houses of Parliament
were conferred on the troops.</p>

<p>The following officers of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were
wounded in the battle of <em>Vimiera</em>: Captains Arthur
Jones and Maxwell Mackenzie; Lieutenants John
Pratt, William Hartley, Augustus M<sup>c</sup>Intyre, and Ralph
Dudgeon; Ensign James Campbell, and Acting Adjutant
R. M<sup>c</sup>Alpin.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> subsequently received the royal
authority to bear the word “<em>Vimiera</em>” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of this battle.</p>

<p>The “<em>Convention of Cintra</em>” was the result of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
victory, and it was signed on the 30th of August. By
its provisions the French army evacuated Portugal,
which country became freed from its oppressors.</p>

<p>The British army was ordered to move forward to
Lisbon, some of the reinforcements for it having preceded
it by water, and occupied the forts at the mouth
of the Tagus. The French army having by this convention
fallen back on Lisbon, the British proceeded to
the vicinity of Fort St. Julien, and encamped.</p>

<p>All the objects of the expedition being carried into
effect, and the French troops embarked for France, the
British army remained for some time at Lisbon and its
vicinity. At this period (September) Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, having assumed the command, made
dispositions for entering Spain.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was now
brigaded with the thirty-sixth and ninety-second regiments
under Brigadier-General Catlin Craufurd, and
placed in the division under the command of Lieut.-General
the Honorable John Hope, afterwards the Earl
of Hopetoun. On the 27th of October the division was
put in motion, and after a short stay at Badajoz resumed
the march, proceeding by Merida, Truxillo, Jaraicejo,
Puerto-de-Merivette, and crossing the Tagus at the
bridge of Almaraz, directed its route upon Talavera-de-la-Reyna.
From this town the column proceeded
to the Escurial, seven leagues to the north-west of
Madrid.</p>

<p>Intelligence was here received of the enemy’s approach
towards Madrid, and two companies of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, under Major Archibald Campbell,
were pushed forward to occupy the important pass in the
Guadarama Mountains, which separate Old from New
Castile. After a halt of a few days, the division was put
in motion over the Guadarama Pass to Villa Castin,
at which place Lieut.-General the Honorable John
Hope, in consequence of the intelligence which he received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the enemy’s movements, made a night march to
the left, by Avila and Peneranda, and finally proceeded
to Alba-de-Tormes. At the latter place a junction was
formed with a detachment from the army under Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, then at Salamanca. The
army under Sir John Moore was shortly afterwards put
in motion towards Valladolid, and subsequently to the
left, to form a junction with Lieut.-General Sir David
Baird’s division, which had landed at Corunna.</p>

<p>Previously to this period, the Spanish armies under
General Blake, near Bilboa on the left, General
Castanos in the centre, and General Palafox lower
down the Ebro on the right, had been completely defeated;
and Lieut.-General Sir John Moore consequently
made arrangements for a retreat on Portugal
by Ciudad Rodrigo; but it having been represented to
him that Madrid held out against the French, he was
induced to effect a junction with Lieut.-General Sir
David Baird, in order to make a diversion in favour of
Madrid, by attacking Marshal Soult on the river
Carion.</p>

<p>The British force, twenty-nine thousand strong, joined
at Toro on the 21st of December, and on the 23d of
that month Sir John Moore advanced with the whole
army. The cavalry had already met with that of the
enemy, and the infantry were within two hours’ march
of him, when an intercepted letter informed the British
commander that Napoleon, who had entered Madrid on
the 4th of December, was then in full march for Salamanca
and Benevente. A retreat on Corunna, through
Gallicia, was immediately decided on, that through
Portugal being then impracticable.</p>

<p>Accordingly the several divisions marched towards
the Esla, the greater part crossing by the bridge of
Benevente on the 26th of December, when, after a
day’s halt, the cavalry under Lieut.-General Lord Paget
and Brigadier-General the Honorable Charles Stewart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
had an engagement with some of the Imperial Guards
that had forded the river Esla under General Le Fevre,
who was made prisoner, with several of his men.</p>

<p>At this period the situation of the British army was
dispiriting in the extreme. In the midst of winter, in
a dreary and desolate country, the soldiers, chilled and
drenched with the heavy rains, and wearied by long
and rapid marches, were almost destitute of fuel to cook
their victuals, and it was with extreme difficulty that
they could procure shelter. Provisions were scarce,
irregularly issued, and difficult of attainment. The
waggons, in which were their magazines, baggage, and
stores, were often deserted in the night by the Spanish
drivers, who were terrified by the approach of the
French. Thus baggage, ammunition, stores, and even
money were destroyed to prevent them falling into the
hands of the enemy; and the weak, the sick, and the
wounded were necessarily left behind. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
suffered in proportion with the rest, and by
weakness, sickness, and fatigue lost about ninety-three
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<p>On the 5th of January 1809, a position was taken up
at Lugo, where some skirmishing occurred, in which
three companies of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were engaged,
and repulsed the enemy.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Francis Dundas was appointed from
the ninety-fourth regiment to be Colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> on the 7th of January 1809, in succession
to Lieut.-General Sir John Francis Cradock,
K.B., removed to the forty-third regiment.</p>

<p>The retreat was again commenced on the 9th of
January; and on the 11th the army, still nearly
fifteen thousand strong, reached <em>Corunna</em>. The British
army, having accomplished one of the most celebrated
retreats recorded in modern history, repulsing the pursuing
enemy in all his attacks, and having traversed two
hundred and fifty miles of mountainous country under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
very disheartening circumstances, accompanied by severe
privation, was not destined to embark for England
without a battle.</p>

<p>The transports not having arrived, a position was occupied
in advance of <em>Corunna</em>, and some sharp skirmishing
ensued, in which four companies of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
were warmly engaged, and lost several men in
killed and wounded. Lieutenant William Lockwood
was severely wounded. On this ground the battle of
<em>Corunna</em> was fought, on the 16th of January; but the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, being placed on the extreme left of
the British line, had little to do therein. The result of
the action was glorious to the British army, but was
darkened by the loss of Lieut.-General Sir John
Moore, who received a severe wound during the battle,
and died at ten o’clock on the same night. His remains
were wrapped in a military cloak, and interred in the
Citadel of Corunna, over which Marshal Soult, with
the true feeling of a soldier, erected a monument.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir David Baird, who succeeded to
the command upon Sir John Moore being wounded,
was also wounded, and the command devolved upon
Lieut.-General the Honorable John Hope.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock on the night of the 16th of January
the troops quitted their position, leaving the piquets
posted, and a few men to keep up the fires, and then
marched into Corunna, where they embarked for England
on the following day.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this battle, and of the conduct
of the battalion during the expedition, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
in common with the army employed under
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, received the royal
authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Corunna</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were conferred
on the troops, and were communicated to Lieut.-Colonel
Pack by Lieut.-General Sir David Baird in
the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Portsmouth, 30th January 1809.</em></p>

<p>“I have great pleasure in transmitting to you
copies of letters from the Lord Chancellor and the
Speaker of the House of Commons, enclosing the
Resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, dated
25th of January 1809, which contain the thanks of
those Houses to the army lately engaged before
Corunna.</p>

<p>“In communicating to you, Sir, this most signal
mark of the approbation of the Parliament of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, allow
me to add my warmest congratulations upon a distinction
which you, and the corps under your command

“<em>Lieut.-General</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<em>Officer commanding First Battalion</em><br />
<span class="smcap pad2">“Seventy-first</span> regiment.”</p>
</div>

<p>After the battalion had landed at Ramsgate, it was
marched to Ashford in Kent, where it continued for
some time, collecting the men, who from contrary winds
were driven into different ports.</p>

<p>While at Ashford the battalion was brigaded with
the Warwick militia and the ninety-first regiment,
under Brigadier-General the Baron de Rottenburg.
Great sickness prevailed at this station, and Surgeon
James Evans and several of the soldiers died of typhus
fever.</p>

<p>On the 20th of March 1809 the Royal authority was
granted for the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> to be formed into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<em>light infantry</em> regiment, when it was directed that the
clothing, arming, and discipline should be the same in
all respects as the forty-third, fifty-second, sixty-eighth,
and eighty-fifth regiments.</p>

<p>The first battalion marched, on the 27th of April
1809, for Brabourne-Lees barracks, and was brigaded
with the sixty-eighth and eighty-fifth light infantry
regiments. Every exertion was here made to increase
the strength and improve the discipline of the corps.
In June the first battalion was increased by a large
reinforcement, consisting of several officers and 311
non-commissioned officers and privates from the second
battalion, which continued to be stationed in North
Britain. Several volunteers from the militia were also
received at this period.</p>

<p>Immense preparations had been made by the British
Government to fit out the most formidable armament
that had for a long time proceeded from England.
The troops amounted to 40,000 men, commanded
by Lieut.-General the Earl of Chatham; the naval
portion consisted of thirty-nine ships of the line,
thirty-six frigates, and numerous gun-boats and bomb-vessels,
and other small craft, under Admiral Sir
Richard Strachan. The object of the expedition was
to obtain possession of the islands at the mouth of the
<em>Scheldt</em>, and to destroy the French ships in that river,
with the docks and arsenals at Antwerp. The first
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, towards the end of
June, received orders to prepare for the above service,
and marched, on the 28th and 29th of that month, in
two divisions, encamping near Gosport.</p>

<p>On the 16th of July the battalion, consisting of three
field officers, six captains, twenty-seven subalterns, five
staff, forty-eight serjeants, and 974 drummers and
rank and file, embarked at Portsmouth on board His
Majesty’s ships <i>Belleisle</i> and <i>Impérieuse</i>, and towards
the end of the month sailed for the Downs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The battalion was brigaded, under Brigadier-General
the Baron de Rottenburg, with the sixty-eighth and
eighty-fifth light infantry, in the division commanded
by Lieut.-General Alexander Mackenzie Fraser, and
in the corps of Lieut.-General Sir Eyre Coote, K.B.</p>

<p>The expedition sailed from the Downs on the 28th
of July, and having arrived off the Roompet Channel,
preparations were made for landing; small craft to cover
the landing were also sent in shore, and the light brigade,
composed of the sixty-eighth, <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and
eighty-fifth light infantry, were landed under their fire.
In an instant they were in contact with the enemy’s
sharpshooters, who fell back, skirmishing. Being pushed
hard, four guns, with their equipment, and several
prisoners were taken by two companies of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
under Captains George Sutherland and Henry
Hall, and one company of the eighty-fifth regiment.</p>

<p>A battery and flagstaff on the coast were taken possession
of by the tenth company of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
and in lieu of a flag a soldier’s red jacket was hoisted
on it.</p>

<p>This advance having succeeded at all points, and the
enemy having fallen back on <em>Flushing</em> and <em>Middleburg</em>,
the army was disembarked. The advance then dividing,
proceeded by different routes. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
moved by the sea dyke on a fort called <em>Ter Veer</em>, the
situation and strength of which was not sufficiently
known, an enemy’s deserter having given but imperfect
intelligence respecting it.</p>

<p>After nightfall the column continued to advance in
perfect silence, with orders to attack the post with the
bayonet, when, on a sudden, the advance-guard fell in
with an enemy’s party, who came out for the purpose
of firing some houses which overlooked the works.
The column following the advance-guard had entered
an avenue or road leading to the fort, when the advance
commenced the action with the enemy, who, retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
within the place, opened a tremendous fire from his
works with artillery and musketry. Some guns pointing
down the road by which the battalion advanced did
great execution, and the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Surgeon
Charles Henry Quin killed, and about eighteen men
killed and wounded. The column, after some firing,
retired, and the place was the next day regularly invested
by sea and land. It took three days to reduce
it, when it capitulated, with its stores, and a garrison
of 800 men.</p>

<p><em>Flushing</em> having been invested on the 1st of August,
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, after the surrender of Ter Veer,
were ordered into the line of circumvallation, and placed
on the extreme left, resting on the Scheldt. The preparations
for the attack on the town having been completed,
on the 13th a dreadful fire was opened from the
batteries and bomb-vessels, and congreve rockets having
been thrown into the town, it was on fire in many
places. The ships having joined in the attack, the
enemy’s fire gradually slackened, and at length ceased.
A summons being sent in, a delay was demanded, but
being rejected, the firing recommenced.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August one of the outworks was
carried at the point of the bayonet by a party of detachments
and two companies of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> under
Lieut.-Colonel Pack.</p>

<p>In this affair, Ensign Donald Sinclair, of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
was killed; Captain George Spottiswoode and
a few men were wounded.</p>

<p><em>Flushing</em>, with its garrison of 6,000 men, capitulated
on the 15th of August, and the right gate was occupied
by a detachment of 300 men of the first or Royal
Scots, and the left gate by a detachment of similar
strength of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> under Major Arthur
Jones. The naval arsenal, and some vessels of war
which were on the stocks, fell into the hands of the
British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> shortly after proceeded to Middleburg,
where the battalion remained for a few days,
when it was ordered to occupy <em>Ter Veer</em>, of which place
Lieut.-Colonel Pack was appointed commandant, and
Lieutenant Henry Clements, of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
town major. The battalion remained doing duty in the
garrison until this island, after destroying the works,
&amp;c., was finally evacuated on the 22d of December.</p>

<p>On the 23d of December the battalion embarked in
transports, and sailed for England, after a service of five
months in a very unhealthy climate, which cost the
battalion the loss of the following officers and men.</p>

<p>In passing Cadsand, that fort opened a fire on the
transports, one of which, having part of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
on board, was struck by a round shot, which
carried off Serjeant Steel’s legs above the knees.</p>

<p>On the 25th of December the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> disembarked at Deal, and marched to
Brabourne-Lees barracks, in Kent, where it was again
brigaded with the sixty-eighth and eighty-fifth light
infantry, and was occupied in putting itself in an
efficient state for active service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>

<p>Upon the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> being made light infantry,
they were permitted to retain such parts of the national
dress as might not be inconsistent with their duties as
a light corps. A correspondence on the subject took
place between Lieut.-Colonel Pack and the Adjutant-General
in April 1810, and the following reply was
received from head-quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>On the 8th of May 1810 the first battalion marched
to Deal barracks, where every exertion was continued
to render it fit for active service. Here the battalion
was deprived of the services of Lieut.-Colonel Pack,
who was appointed a brigadier in the Portuguese army
under Marshal William Carr Beresford, afterwards
General the Viscount Beresford.</p>

<p>Nothing of moment occurred until the early part of
September, when the battalion received orders to hold
six companies in readiness for foreign service. They
were prepared accordingly by drafting into them, from
the companies which were to remain at home, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
effective officers and men, several not having recovered
from the Walcheren fever.</p>

<p>The following were the companies selected and completed
for foreign service, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">They consisted of two field officers, six captains, fifteen
lieutenants, seven ensigns, four staff, thirty-eight serjeants,
twelve drummers, and six hundred and three
rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 14th of September the above companies
embarked in the Downs on board the Melpomene and
St. Fiorenzo frigates; three companies, with the staff,
and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Nathaniel Levett Peacocke,
on board the former; the remaining three companies,
under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Reynell, afterwards
colonel of the regiment, on board the latter.
They sailed on the following day for Lisbon, and
entered the Tagus on the 25th of September, after a
short and pleasant passage. The companies were disembarked
on the following day, and quartered in the
San Benito and Espirito Santo convents.</p>

<p>The greatest exertions were made to complete the
companies in field equipment, bât-mules, &amp;c., which
being effected, the detachment marched from Lisbon
on the 2d of October to Mafra, where it was shortly afterwards
joined by Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry
Cadogan, who assumed the command, and Lieut.-Colonel
Peacocke returned to the second battalion in
North Britain.</p>

<p>The detachment being ordered to join the army
under Lieut.-General Viscount Wellington, then retreating
before Marshal Massena, Prince of Essling,
marched from Mafra on the 8th of October, and on the
10th of that month effected the junction at Sobral,
where it was brigaded with the fiftieth and ninety-second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
regiments under Major-General Sir William
Erskine, in the first division under Lieut.-General Sir
Brent Spencer, K.B.</p>

<p>The army having retired into a position in the rear of
Sobral, that place was occupied by the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
having for its support the fiftieth and ninety-second
regiments and Major-General Alan Cameron’s brigade.
On the 12th of October the piquets were violently
attacked by the enemy’s advance, and retired skirmishing.
In the meantime the place was ordered to be
evacuated, and the piquets having joined, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
took up a position on the outside, within musket-shot
of the town. In this affair the detachment had
eight men killed, and thirty-four wounded.</p>

<p>In this position the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> continued, when
on the 14th of October they were again attacked
with the greatest impetuosity, and charged with the
bayonet. The enemy was completely repulsed, with
very considerable loss in killed and wounded, being
chased to the spot from which he made the attack.
Both parties resumed their original position.</p>

<p>In Viscount Wellington’s despatch reporting this
affair, the names of Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Henry Cadogan, commanding the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
and that of Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Reynell,
were particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>A soldier of the sixth company, named John Rea,
behaved on this occasion in the most gallant manner,
and particularly distinguished himself, for which he
received a silver medal, with the following inscription:
“To John Rea, for his exemplary courage and good
conduct as a soldier at Sobral, 14th October 1810.”</p>

<p>On the 15th of October the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were
ordered to withdraw into the position at Zibriera,
which was a continuation of the lines of Torres Vedras.
In this celebrated position, which bid defiance to the
French army, the troops were constantly on the alert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and occupied in rendering it as strong as circumstances
would admit, and in observing the motions of the
enemy.</p>

<p>Marshal Massena did not think proper to attack the
British army in this stronghold, and occupied his time
in reconnoissances and demonstrations, until compelled,
through want of provisions, and consequent sickness of
his troops, to abandon his designs, and retire to a
position in his rear. This object he finally effected in
a masterly manner in the night between the 14th and
15th of November, followed by the allied forces. Both
armies thus evacuated positions on which the attention
of Europe had been fixed, and which they had occupied
for a month in the presence of each other.</p>

<p>The division in which the six companies of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were placed advanced by the route of
Alemquer, Cartaxo, Atelaya, and Almoster, and halted
in and about the latter place from the 20th to the 26th
of November inclusive. The enemy in the meantime
retired to an extremely strong position at and in the
vicinity of Santarem, where Marshal Massena halted,
although threatened by Viscount Wellington, who,
after some manœuvring, took up a position immediately
in the enemy’s front, having his head-quarters at Cartaxo,
and the different corps of the army cantoned in
the villages. The brigade to which the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
belonged occupied Alquintrinha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811.</div>

<p>At this place the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> remained in quarters
until March 1811, at which period the army, having
been reinforced<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, was about to resume the offensive,
when the enemy retired during the night of the 5th of
March, taking the same road, through Estremadura, by
which he entered Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The British army accordingly advanced in pursuit of
Marshal Massena, and the brigade in which was the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> accompanied it, moving by Redinha,
Miranda de Corvo, and Saryedes, passing the Coa, a
little above Sabugal, upon the 5th of April, and on the
9th arrived at Albergaria, a small town on the frontiers
of Spain. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> remained in Albergaria
until the 2d of May, when the enemy, having been
strongly reinforced, moved from Salamanca, and on
that day crossed the frontier with a large convoy of
provisions for Almeida, then closely invested by the
Portuguese forces under Brigadier-General Pack.</p>

<p>In consequence of this movement, the allied army
broke up its cantonments on the Azava, and formed in
order of battle upon the high ground behind the Duas
Casas, the left extending to the high road to Almeida
which crossed the river by a ford near Fort Conception,
and the right keeping up a communication with the
bridge at Sabugal; opposite the centre, the village
of <em>Fuentes d’Onor</em> was strongly occupied by light
infantry.</p>

<p>Upon the 3d of May the French took post on the
opposite side of the valley of the Duas Casas, their
left fronting Fuentes d’Onor, and their right extending
about two miles and a half to Alameda. In the afternoon
of the 3d of May they attacked Fuentes d’Onor
with much vigour. That post was defended with the
greatest bravery until the light companies, being worn
out and harassed by repeated attacks, were obliged to
retire, and the enemy possessed himself of the lower
part of the village.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were now ordered up to support,
and, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Henry Cadogan, charged the enemy through the
village and across the Duas Casas, taking ten officers
and about a hundred men prisoners. The corps retained
its conquest that night and the whole of the next day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
but upon Sunday the 5th of May, the French having
succeeded in turning some troops to the immediate
right, were obliged to give way; having been immediately
supported by the seventy-fourth and eighty-eighth
regiments, they again advanced, took possession
of and retained the village until the conclusion of the
action.</p>

<p>A struggle of such duration could not be carried on
without great loss, and the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> suffered
severely. They went into action about 320 strong,
and lost nearly one half of their number in killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Lieutenants John Consell,
William Houston, and John Graham, and Ensign
Donald John Kearns, together with four serjeants and
twenty-two rank and file, killed.</p>

<p>Captains Peter Adamson and James M<sup>c</sup>Intyre,
Lieutenants William M<sup>c</sup>Craw, Humphrey Fox, and
Robert Law (Adjutant), Ensigns Charles Cox, John
Vandeleur, and Carique Lewin, six serjeants, three
buglers, and one hundred rank and file, were wounded.
Two officers, with several men, were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the gallantry displayed in this
prolonged action, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> subsequently
received the Royal authority to bear the words
“<span class="smcap">Fuentes d’Onor</span>” on the regimental colour and
appointments.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington particularly mentioned the name
of Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry Cadogan in
his despatch, and being highly gratified with the conduct
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> on this occasion, directed
that a non-commissioned officer should be selected for a
commission. According to his Lordship’s recommendation,
Quartermaster-Serjeant William Gavin was shortly
afterwards promoted to an ensigncy in the regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, upon the 14th, returned to
their old quarters at Albergaria, and remained there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
until the 26th of May, when the brigade was ordered
to the Alemtejo frontier, as a reinforcement to Marshal
Sir William Beresford’s<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> army, at this time besieging
Badajoz, and threatened by the advance of Marshal
Soult from the south of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>On the 15th of May 1811, the second battalion
embarked at Leith for South Britain, arrived at Ramsgate
on the 23d of that month, and remained stationed
in England for nearly two years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>The first battalion, upon its route southward, crossed
the Tagus on the 31st of May, and arrived near
Albuhera on the 14th of June, having passed through
Portalegre, Aronches, Campo Mayor, and Talavera
Real.</p>

<p>The sanguinary battle of Albuhera, fought on the
16th of May, had obliged Marshal Soult to retire previously
to the arrival of the reinforcement, which
being considered no longer necessary, the battalion
retired to Elvas, where it remained two days; the battalion
again moved to Toro de Moro on the 19th of
June, where it remained for a month. At this encampment
a detachment of 350 men, with a proportion of
officers, joined from the second battalion then stationed
at Deal.</p>

<p>About this period the first battalion became a part of
the army under Lieut.-General Rowland (afterwards
Viscount) Hill. The junction of the armies of Marshals
Marmont and Soult having obliged Viscount Wellington
to raise the siege of Badajoz, which had been resumed
after the battle of Albuhera, the battalion, in co-operation
with his Lordship’s retrograde movement, retired to
Borba on the 20th of July. Here it remained until the
1st of September, when it moved to Portalegre, and
thence marched to Castello de Vido on the 4th of
October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>A detachment from Marshal Soult’s army under
General Girard having been collecting contributions
in Spanish Estremadura, Lieut.-General Rowland Hill,
with a view of putting a stop to his movements, broke
up his cantonments at Portalegre upon the 22d of
October, proceeding by Albuquerque and Malpartida.
On the 27th, when within a moderate march of the
enemy at <em>Arroyo-del-Molinos</em>, Lieut.-General Hill
halted his troops, and, at night, breaking up his bivouac,
made a flank movement close to the road by which the
French intended to march on the following morning.
In that position he awaited the approach of day, when,
on the 28th of October, the British marched directly
on the rear of the town with such celerity that the
cavalry piquets were rushed upon before they had time
to mount. The French main body, though in the act of
filing out, had so little intimation of danger that the
officers and men were surrounded before their formation
was effected, and to seek safety they individually dispersed.
Many of them were killed, and about 1,400
were taken prisoners. All the enemy’s artillery and
baggage were captured. General Brun and Colonel
the Prince of Aremberg, together with several other
officers, were among the prisoners.</p>

<p>In this brilliant affair the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was one
of the three corps that advanced through the centre of
the town, and were, therefore, principally engaged; but
the enemy, from his complete surprise, being unable to
make a combined resistance, the British sustained but
trifling loss.</p>

<p>The battalion subsequently returned to Portalegre,
where it arrived early in November.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Hill, on the 7th of November, issued
the following General Order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Portalegre, 7th November 1811.</em></p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Hill has great satisfaction in congratulating
the troops on the success which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
attended their recent operations in Estremadura, and
in so doing he cannot but endeavour to do justice to
the merits of those through whose exertions it has
been obtained. A patient willing endurance of forced
and night marches, during the worst of weather and
over bad roads, of bivouacs in wet weather, oftentimes
without cover and without fire, and a strict
observance of discipline, are qualities, however common
in British soldiers, which the Lieut.-General
cannot pass unnoticed. Having on this occasion
witnessed the exertion of them in no ordinary degree,
he feels that nothing but the most zealous attention
of commanding officers, the goodwill and zealous
spirit of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers,
could produce such an effect, and he requests they
will, generally and individually, accept his warmest
thanks, particularly those corps which were engaged
in the action of <em>Arroyo-del-Molinos</em>, whose silent
attention to orders, when preparing to attack, and
when manœuvring before the enemy, could not but
excite his notice, and give them an additional claim
on him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Letters from the Secretary of State, dated the 2d,
and from His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
Commander-in-Chief, dated the 6th December, were
promulgated, expressive of His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent’s approbation and thanks to Lieut.-General
Hill, and the troops under his command, for
their brilliant operations on the recent expedition in
Spanish Estremadura, in having totally surprised and
defeated the enemy under General Girard.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington having made preparations for
the recapture of <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, concentrated the main
body of the army in that neighbourhood, and the troops
under Lieut.-General Hill were therefore ordered to
divert the enemy’s attention in the south.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
at Portalegre until the 25th of December, when the
brigade moved into Estremadura for the purpose of
expelling the French, who were ravaging the country.
After the performance of this duty, the battalion
returned to its former quarters at Portalegre in
February 1812.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<p>Upon the 19th of March 1812, the battalion moved
northward to Castello Branco, where it remained for
about a week, and afterwards returned for the last time
to Portalegre.</p>

<p>The Earl of Wellington having made arrangements
for the third siege of <em>Badajoz</em>, Lieutenant-General Sir
Rowland Hill’s<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> corps was destined to cover his movements,
and with that view proceeded on the 21st of
March towards Merida, and afterwards to Don Benito,
where the troops remained for a few days; but upon
the approach of Marshal Soult with a large army, with
the intention of raising the siege, Lieut.-General Hill
retired upon Albuhera, through Arroyo de San Servan
and Talavera Real.</p>

<p>Badajoz having been assaulted and carried by the
troops under the Earl of Wellington on the night of
the 6th of April, after a sanguinary conflict, the movement
of Marshal Soult was rendered nugatory, and the
troops under his orders retired into Andalusia.</p>

<p>Marshal Marmont having, during the progress of
the siege, penetrated into the province of Beira, and
threatened Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, the Earl of
Wellington, after the fall of Badajoz, crossed the Tagus,
leaving Sir Rowland Hill’s force to watch Marshal
Soult, which took post at Almendralejos for that purpose.</p>

<p>The battalion was stationed at this town from the
13th of April until the 11th of May. It having then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
become expedient to render the communications between
the French armies on the north and south of the Tagus
as precarious as possible, by the destruction of the
bridge of boats at <em>Almaraz</em>, the corps under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill, being the most disposable
and convenient force, was accordingly ordered on this
important service.</p>

<p>The French, feeling the importance of this bridge to
their mutual strength and security, had surrounded
it on both sides of the river with formidable enclosed
works, having in the interior of them casemated and
loop-holed towers. The troops appointed for these
strong works, consequently, anticipated an arduous
struggle.</p>

<p>Upon the 12th of May the corps broke up from
Almendralejos, and marching by Truxillo and Jaraicejo,
reached on the 18th of that month the sierra, five miles
from Almaraz, on which stands the Castle of Mirabete.
This post was so strongly fortified that it blocked up
the only road to Almaraz for the passage of artillery,
which was considered by the enemy absolutely necessary
for the destruction of the works. Sir Rowland Hill
thought otherwise; and ascertaining that infantry could
cross the sierra by a track through Roman Gordo, he
left his artillery, and descended at night with a column
of 2,000 men. The leading company arrived at dawn
of day close to the principal fort, built on a height a
few hundred yards in front of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i>; but such
were the difficulties of the road that a considerable time
elapsed before the rear closed, during which the troops
were fortunately sheltered by a ravine, unseen by the
enemy.</p>

<p>On the 19th of May the fiftieth regiment and the left
wing of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, having been provided
with ladders, were appointed to escalade the works of
<em>Fort Napoleon</em>, supported by the right wing of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and the ninety-second regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>From a feint made upon Mirabete, the French were
aware that an enemy was in the neighbourhood. The
garrison was on the alert; immediately opened a heavy
fire, and vigorously resisted the efforts made to push
up the scarp; but the moment the first men gained a
footing on the parapet the enemy took to flight. The
whole of this brilliant affair was completed in the short
space of fifteen minutes, and with little loss.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Captain Lewis Grant, with
one serjeant and seven rank and file, killed; Lieutenants
William Lockwood and Donald Ross, three serjeants,
and twenty-nine rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The names of thirty-six non-commissioned officers
and soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were inserted in
regimental orders for conspicuous bravery upon this
occasion, and the Royal authority was subsequently
granted for the word “<span class="smcap">Almaraz</span>” to be borne on the
regimental colour and appointments.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The following orders were issued upon this occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Truxillo, May 22nd, 1812.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">“General Order.</p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill congratulates
the troops on the success which has attended their
exertions in the present expedition. Every object
for which it was undertaken has been attained, and in
the manner most desirable and effectual. It is highly
gratifying to the Lieut.-General to report on this
occasion his admiration of the discipline and the valour
of the troops under his command. The chance of war
gave to the fiftieth and <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiments the
most conspicuous share in these events, who nobly
profited by the opportunity; but the Lieut.-General
is satisfied that the same zeal and the same spirit
would have been found in every corps if there had
been occasion for bringing them into play.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General has not failed to report to his
Excellency the Commander of the Forces the particulars
of this brilliant service, and the good conduct
of all those concerned in it. He will therefore not
say more at present than to express his warmest
thanks for the assistance which he has received from
all ranks; and he is confident, when it shall again be
his good fortune to lead them against the enemy, he
shall have to report conduct equally honorable to
them, and equally advantageous to their country.”</p>
</div>

<p>The bridge and works in the neighbourhood of
Almaraz having been completely destroyed, the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> returned to Truxillo, where they
remained a few days, then moved to Merida, and afterwards
to Almendralejos. Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill’s force having received orders to make a diversion
in the south, while the main army was moving northward
on <em>Salamanca</em>, the battalion again moved from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Almendralejos to the borders of Andalusia, through
Llerena. On this march the advanced parties of
cavalry were constantly skirmishing with the enemy,
but the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were not engaged.</p>

<p>From Llerena the battalion returned to Zafra, where,
after a short halt, it proceeded to Villa Franca, and
finally to Don Benito. In these marches through
Estremadura the weather was oppressively hot, and,
joined to the clouds of dust raised by the troops, was
so fatiguing that it was considered expedient at one
time to move by night, and thus these inconveniences
were alleviated.</p>

<p>While the force under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill had been thus employed, the allied army under the
Earl of Wellington had gained a victory on the 22d of
July over the French at <em>Salamanca</em>, for which he was
advanced to the dignity of marquis.</p>

<p>From Don Benito the battalion moved upon the
13th of September, and passing through Truxillo,
Talavera, and Toledo, arrived at Aranjuez upon the 1st
of October, from which place, after a halt of three
weeks, it moved to Ponte Duenna, further up the
Tagus.</p>

<p>The sudden approach of the united armies of Marshals
Soult and Suchet rendered a speedy retreat necessary,
and the division accordingly retired from Ponte Duenna
in the night of the 28th of October, moving to form a
junction with the army of the Marquis of Wellington,
who had now relinquished the siege of Burgos. Near
Madrid the division halted for a short period, when,
being joined by the garrison of that city, the troops
retired leisurely by the Guadarama Pass on Alba de
Tormes. This town the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> occupied
from the 7th to the 13th of November, and during
that period sustained a loss in action with the enemy
of one serjeant and six rank and file killed; one bugler
and five rank and file wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The army having received orders to retire on Portugal,
the battalion abandoned this post, arriving at
Coria upon the 1st of December, where the retreat
terminated. In this quarter the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> continued
until the 13th of December, at which time they
were pushed forward to Puerto de Bannos, where they
were joined by a draft of 150 men from the second
battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813.</div>

<p>While stationed at this post, an attempt was made, in
February 1813, by the French, to surprise Bejar, then
occupied by the <em>fiftieth</em> regiment. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
were ordered forward to support, but previously
to their arrival that brave regiment had driven back the
enemy, and completely foiled his efforts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>On the 18th of March 1813, the second battalion of
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> embarked at Gravesend for North
Britain, and arrived at Leith on the 23d of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>Upon the 5th of April the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> changed
quarters with the fiftieth regiment, and continued to
occupy Bejar until the 21st of May, at which period
the army broke up from its winter cantonments for
active operations. The battalion on its advance moved
by Salamanca and Toro, and encamped at La Puebla
on the 20th of June, the evening before the memorable
battle of <em>Vittoria</em>.</p>

<p>Upon the morning of the 21st of June, the two
armies being in position, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were
ordered to ascend the heights of La Puebla, to support
the Spanish forces under General Morillo. They accordingly
advanced in open column, and having formed
line, were immediately hotly engaged with the enemy,
and upon this occasion suffered an irreparable loss in the
fall of their Commanding Officer the Honorable Colonel
Henry Cadogan, who fell mortally wounded while
leading his men to the charge, and being unable to
accompany the battalion, requested to be carried to a
neighbouring eminence, from which he might take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
last farewell of them and the field. In his dying
moments he earnestly inquired if the French were
beaten; and on being told by an officer of the regiment,
who stood by supporting him, that they had given way
at all points, he ejaculated, “God bless my brave
countrymen” and immediately expired.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>While recording the deep sense of sorrow which the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> experienced in the demise of a commanding
officer who had so often fought at their head,
and whose devoted gallantry had so frequently called
forth their admiration, it is but a meet tribute to the
memory of that brave spirit to extract from the despatch
of the Marquis of Wellington the following
expressions of his lordship’s regret at his loss:</p>

<p>“And I am concerned to report that the Honorable
Lieut.-Colonel Cadogan has died of a wound which
he received. In him His Majesty has lost an officer
of great zeal and tried gallantry, who had already
acquired the respect and regard of the whole profession,
and of whom it might be expected, that if he
had lived he would have rendered the most important
services to his country.”</p>

<p>After the fall of the Lieut.-Colonel, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
continued advancing, and driving the enemy
from the heights, until the force which was opposed to
them became so unequal, and the loss of the battalion
so severe, that it was obliged to retire upon the
remainder of the brigade. In the performance of this
arduous duty the battalion suffered very severely,
having had one field officer, one captain, two lieutenants,
six serjeants, one bugler, and seventy-eight rank
and file killed; one field officer, three captains, seven
lieutenants, thirteen serjeants, two buglers, and two
hundred and fifty-five rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The officers killed were Colonel the Honorable Henry
Cadogan, Captain Henry Hall, Lieutenants Humphrey
Fox and Colin Mackenzie. Those wounded were Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Charles Cother, Captains Samuel Reed,
Joseph Thomas Pidgeon, William Alexander Grant,
Lieutenants Alexander Duff, Loftus Richards, John
M<sup>c</sup>Intyre, Charles Cox, William Torriano, Norman
Campbell, and Thomas Commeline.</p>

<p>On this occasion the French suffered a great loss of
men, together with all their artillery, baggage, and
stores. King Joseph, whose carriage and court equipage
was seized, had barely time to escape on horseback.
The defeat was the most complete that the
French had sustained in the Peninsula. It was this
victory which gained a bâton for the Marquis of
Wellington, who was appointed a Field Marshal. In
a most flattering letter, the Prince Regent, in the name
and behalf of His Majesty, thus conferred the honor:
“You have sent me among the trophies of your unrivalled
fame the staff of a French Marshal, and I
send you in return that of England.” This was in
allusion to the bâton of Marshal Jourdan, which was
taken by the eighty-seventh regiment at Vittoria.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> subsequently received the
Royal authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>” on the
regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of this signal victory.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> paraded on the morning
of the 22d of June, the dreadful havoc made by the
action of the preceding day became painfully manifest,
and an universal gloom was thrown over all, at missing
from their ranks nearly four hundred brave comrades
who had been either killed or wounded on the heights
of La Puebla.</p>

<p>The enemy, having been completely beaten at all
points, was forced to retreat in confusion on Pampeluna,
and the British army immediately followed in pursuit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
The battalion in this advance arrived at Pampeluna on
the 29th of June, and shortly afterwards followed, as
part of Sir Rowland Hill’s army, a large force of the
enemy, who were retreating into France by the valley
of Bastan. During this forward movement the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had some skirmishing in the valley
of <em>Elizondo</em>, but without loss. Upon the 8th of July
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> arrived at the heights of Maya,
from whence, for the first time, they had the cheering
prospect of beholding the empire of France extended
before them in all its fertile beauty. Joy was diffused
through every heart; every trial and danger were forgotten
while viewing this splendid and gratifying sight.
Upon these heights the battalion was encamped until
the 25th of July.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult having been selected by Napoleon
for the command of the French army in Spain, with
the rank of “Lieutenant of the Emperor,” that officer
used the most active exertions for its re-organization,
and made immediate arrangements for forcing the
British position in the Pyrenees. With this view he
advanced in person with a large force against the right,
stationed at Roncesvalles, and detached Count D’Erlon
with about thirteen thousand men to attack the position
of <em>Maya</em>.</p>

<p>The Count D’Erlon, upon the 25th of July, advanced
against the right of the <em>Maya</em> heights, where the
ridges of the mountains branched off towards his camp.
The force at this point was not sufficient to resist such
formidable numbers, and the reserve being posted at
some distance to watch passes of importance, which
could not be left wholly unguarded, was brought up
by battalions as the pressure increased.</p>

<p>The intrepidity with which these attacks were met,
and the obstinate bravery with which every inch of
ground was disputed, were obliged at last to yield to
overwhelming numbers; but although the troops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
forced to retrograde, yet in their retreat they took
advantage of every rising ground, and disputed it with
the utmost tenacity. At the commencement of this
attack a part of the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment was detached to a neighbouring high
peak, under the command of Major William Fitzgerald
of the eighty-second regiment, and was strengthened
by a company of that gallant corps. Lieut.-General the
Honorable Sir William Stewart, in his report to Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill, thus expressed himself
respecting these men:&mdash;“I cannot too warmly praise
the conduct of that field officer (Major Fitzgerald)
and that of his brave detachment. They maintained
the position to the last; and were compelled, from
the want of ammunition, to impede the enemy’s
occupation of the rock by hurling stones at them.”</p>

<p>In another part of this communication, the Lieut.-General
thus alluded to the eighty-second regiment
and to the first brigade, which was composed of the
fiftieth, <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and ninety-second regiments:</p>

<p>“I feel it my duty to recommend to your attention,
and favourable report to the Commander of the
Forces, the conduct and spirit of Colonel Grant,
and of his brave corps, the eighty-second regiment;
also the whole of the first brigade, than which His
Majesty’s army possesses not men of more proved
discipline and courage. The wounds of him, and
every commanding officer in that brigade, were attended
with circumstances of peculiar honor to each
of them, and to those under their orders.”</p>

<p>The following is a list of the killed and wounded in
the action of the 25th of July, as nearly as could be
ascertained:&mdash;Three serjeants and fifty-four rank and
file killed; six serjeants, one bugler, and seventy-six
rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> continued retiring until the
30th, when Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a strong position beyond Lizasso. In this post they
were attacked with much spirit by the enemy, who, at
the same time, by manœuvring on the left flank, rendered
necessary a change of position to a range of
heights near <em>Eguaros</em>, which all the efforts of the
French failed to carry. Upon this occasion the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were seriously engaged, and had one
serjeant and twenty-three rank and file killed; two
serjeants, one bugler, and thirty-three rank and file
were wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy having been foiled in all the objects of
his attacks, found it necessary, in his turn, to retreat,
moving on the 31st of July by the pass of <em>Doña Maria</em>,
where he left a strong corps in an excellent position.
This force was immediately attacked by the columns
of Lieut.-Generals Sir Rowland Hill and the Earl of
Dalhousie, and dislodged, after a gallant resistance.
In the action of this day the first brigade, consisting
of the fiftieth, <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, and ninety-second
regiments, had the honor of bearing its share, and of
distinguishing itself. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had one
serjeant and twenty-nine rank and file killed; two
serjeants and forty-five rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>The battalion now returned to the heights of Maya,
from whence, after a halt of a few days, it moved to
Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>Previously to this change of quarters, an order was
issued by Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, relative to
the conduct of the troops in the actions of the Pyrenees,
of which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Arrizi, August 3rd, 1813.</em></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></p>

<p>“Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill requests that the
officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the
corps of the army under his command will accept
his best thanks for the gallant conduct they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
displayed during the late active and interesting
operations.</p>

<p>“The chance of service has placed the troops under
his command in situations where they were exposed
to an immense superiority of forces, a circumstance
unavoidable in operations so extensive as those in
which this army has been engaged; and it has at all
times been necessary to cede ground to the enemy.
The Lieut.-General, however, has the satisfaction of
knowing that the troops have on every occasion
maintained their high character; that they have
only withdrawn from their positions by superior
orders, and then it has been invariably attended with
circumstances highly creditable to them. The Lieut.-General
has not failed to report to the Commander
of the Forces the details of the several affairs in
which the corps have been engaged, and he knows
that their services are duly appreciated by his
Excellency.”</p>
</div>

<p>The royal authority was subsequently granted to
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>”
on the regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of the services of the first battalion in the
actions of the 25th, 30th, and 31st of July, which have
been designated the “<em>Battles of the Pyrenees</em>.”</p>

<p>In these actions the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Lieutenant
Alexander Duff killed; Major Maxwell Mackenzie,
Captains Leslie Walker and Alexander Grant, Lieutenants
Thomas Park, John Roberts, William Woolcombe,
William Peacocke, and Anthony Pack wounded.</p>

<p>The following “Morning Reports” of the 14th of
June and 7th of August, the former being prior to the
battle of Vittoria, and the latter a few days subsequent
to the actions in the Pyrenees, will show how the ranks
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were thinned within a period
of less than two months.</p>

<p>For nearly three months the battalion was encamped
on the heights of Roncesvalles, during which period
<em>St. Sebastian</em> and <em>Pampeluna</em> were captured. The
men were principally employed during this interval in
the construction of block-houses and batteries, and the
formation of roads for the artillery.</p>

<p>In the early part of the season the neighbouring
heights of <em>Altobispo</em> were occupied weekly by the brigades
of the division; but as the cold increased with
the high winds, the piquets alone were appointed for
this duty. Such was the inclemency of the weather,
and natural advantages of this position, that it was
scarcely thought that the enemy would attempt an
attack. This opinion, however, was ill founded, as
upon the night of the 11th of October an attempt was
made by a strong party upon the advance, composed of
fifteen men of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, under Serjeant
James Ross. Instead of flinching from an unequal
contest, this small band, relying upon the strength of
the position, and being, moreover, favored by the
darkness, which concealed its strength, maintained its
ground, and forced the enemy to retire. The bravery
of this party called forth high encomiums from Lieut.-General
the Honorable Sir William Stewart, commanding
the division, and at his request the soldiers
composing it were all presented with medals.</p>

<p>On the 8th of November the division was again in
motion, for the purpose of entering the French territory;
and on the 9th of that month it bivouacked near
the heights of Maya, where orders were received to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
march as light as possible. The heights were passed
that night by moonlight, for the purpose of joining the
grand army; but the march over bad roads was so
fatiguing that when the brigade arrived in position on
the <em>Nivelle</em> it was not called upon to take an active
part in the glorious proceedings of the rest of the army
on the 10th of November, in forcing the French from
their fortified position on that river.</p>

<p>After the battle of the Nivelle, the battalion marched
in the direction of Cambo, on the Nive, where some
smart skirmishing occurred, in which two men were
killed, and four serjeants, one bugler, and forty-one
rank and file wounded. When the French crossed to
the right bank, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> occupied part of
the town of Cambo.</p>

<p>The battalion remained in Cambo for nearly a month,
and was here joined by a detachment of four serjeants
and eighty-two rank and file, under the command of
Lieutenant Charles Henderson, from the second battalion,
at this period stationed at Glasgow.</p>

<p>On the 9th of December the first battalion was engaged
in the passage of the <em>Nive</em>. The left wing of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> entered the river, supported by the
fire of the right, and reached the opposite bank without
experiencing any loss.</p>

<p>The enemy now retired within Bayonne, and the
corps of Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill was established
with its right on the Adour, the left above the
Nive, and the centre at <em>St. Pierre</em>, across the high road
to St. Jean Pied-de-Port.</p>

<p>In this disposition the second division, of which the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> formed part, was placed at St. Pierre.
Marshal Soult having completely failed in an attempt
which he made against the left of the army, moved
with his whole force against Sir Rowland Hill’s corps,
with the expectation of overwhelming him before he
could be supported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy came on with great boldness upon the
13th of December, and made vigorous efforts against
the centre, which he repeatedly attacked; but at last,
finding his most earnest endeavours fruitless, he drew
off. In the action of this day the loss of the first battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment was very severe,
having been placed close to the main road, against which
the French made such formidable and repeated attacks.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell Mackenzie, and
Lieutenants William Campbell and Charles Henderson,
together with two serjeants, one bugler, and twenty-three
rank and file were killed. Captains Robert
Barclay and William Alexander Grant, and Lieutenants
John M<sup>c</sup>Intyre and William Torriano, with
thirty-seven rank and file, were wounded.</p>

<p>The following short but highly expressive Division
Order was issued by Lieutenant General the Honorable
Sir William Stewart, K.B.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Head-Quarters, near Petite Moguerre,</em><br />
<span class="padr4">“<em>December 14th, 1813.</em></span></p>

<p>“The second division has greatly distinguished itself,
and its gallantry in yesterday’s action is avowed
by the Commander of the Forces and the allied
army.”</p>
</div>

<p>In commemoration of these services, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
subsequently received the Royal authority to
bear the word “<span class="smcap">Nive</span>” on the regimental colour and
appointments.</p>

<p>The battalion marched on the 19th of December to
Urcuit, and to Urt upon the 28th of that month. A
small piquet of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, under the command
of Corporal Dogherty, here distinguished itself,
by beating off an enemy’s party of nearly treble its
strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814.</div>

<p>While stationed in this quarter, the companies were
frequently engaged in skirmishes with the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
particularly at St. Hellette, heights of Garris, and
St. Palais, in the month of January 1814.</p>

<p>In the beginning of February the battalion marched
from Urt, and during its advance had frequent skirmishes
with the enemy’s rear-guard.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February the battalion was in action
at <em>Sauveterre</em>, and upon the 27th had the honor of participating
in the battle of <em>Orthes</em>.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this victory the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
afterwards received the Royal authority to
bear the word “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>” on the regimental colour
and appointments.</p>

<p>Two divisions of the French army having retired to
<em>Aire</em>, after the action of the 27th of February, Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill moved upon that town to
dislodge them. Upon the 2d of March the French
were found strongly posted upon a ridge of hills, extending
across the great road in front of the town,
having their right on the Adour. The second division
attacked them along the road, seconded by a Portuguese
brigade, and drove them from their position, in gallant
style. Lieutenant James Anderson and seventeen
rank and file were killed; Lieutenant Henry Frederick
Lockyer, one serjeant, and nineteen rank and file,
were wounded.</p>

<p>A detachment from the second battalion, consisting of
one captain, four subalterns, and a hundred and thirty-four
rank and file, under the command of Major Arthur
Jones, joined at Aire.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March part of the battalion was
engaged in an affair at <em>Tarbes</em>, in which Lieutenant
Robert Law was wounded, and upon the 10th of April
was in position at <em>Toulouse</em>, where some of the companies
were employed skirmishing, and sustained a loss of one
serjeant and three rank and file killed; six rank and
file were wounded.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th of April the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
troops evacuated <em>Toulouse</em>, and a white flag was hoisted.
On the following day the Marquis of Wellington entered
the city, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants.
In the course of the afternoon of the 12th of April
intelligence was received of the abdication of Napoleon,
and had not the express been delayed on the journey
by the French police the sacrifice of many valuable
lives would have been prevented.</p>

<p>A disbelief in the truth of this intelligence occasioned
much unnecessary bloodshed at <em>Bayonne</em>, the
garrison of which made a desperate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i> on the 14th
of April, and Lieutenant Sir John Hope (afterwards
Earl of Hopetoun) was taken prisoner. Major-General
Andrew Hay was killed, and Major-General Stopford
was wounded.</p>

<p>A treaty of peace was established between Great
Britain and France; Louis XVIII. was restored to the
throne of France; and Napoleon Bonaparte was permitted
to reside at Elba, the sovereignty of that island
having been conceded to him by the allied powers.</p>

<p>The war being ended, the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment marched from Toulouse to
Blanchfort, where it was encamped for sixteen days,
and afterwards proceeded to Pouillac, where it embarked
on the 15th of July for England, on board of His
Majesty’s ship “Sultan,” of seventy-four guns.</p>

<p>Prior to the breaking up of the Peninsular army,
the Duke of Wellington issued the following General
Order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Bordeaux, 14th June 1814.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces, being upon the
point of returning to England, again takes this opportunity
of congratulating the army upon the recent
events which have restored peace to their country
and to the world.</p>

<p>“The share which the British army have had in
producing those events, and the high character with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
which the army will quit this country, must be
equally satisfactory to every individual belonging
to it, as they are to the Commander of the Forces, and
he trusts that the troops will continue the same good
conduct to the last.</p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces once more requests
the army to accept his thanks.</p>

<p>“Although circumstances may alter the relations
in which he has stood towards them for some years
so much to his satisfaction, he assures them he will
never cease to feel the warmest interest in their
welfare and honor, and that he will be at all times
happy to be of any service to those to whose
conduct, discipline, and gallantry their country is so
much indebted.”</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the other distinctions acquired during
the war in Spain, Portugal, and the south of France,
the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> subsequently received the Royal
authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>” on the
regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The first battalion arrived at Cork on the 28th of
July, and marched to Mallow, where it remained for
a few days. On the 4th of August the battalion
marched to Limerick, where Colonel Reynell assumed
the command of it in December, and in which city it
continued to be quartered during the remainder of the
year.</p>

<div class="sidenotex"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>The second battalion remained stationed in North
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815.<br />
<span class="fs70">1st bat.</span></div>

<p>In January 1815, the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment marched from Limerick to Cork, and
embarked as part of an expedition under orders for North
America. Peace having been concluded with the United
States, and contrary winds having prevented the sailing
of the vessels, the destination of the battalion was
changed, and subsequent events occasioned its being employed
against its former opponents. The tranquillity
which Europe appeared to have gained by the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
successes over the French in the Peninsula was
again to be disturbed. Napoleon, who had been accustomed
to imperial sway, was naturally discontented
with his small sovereignty of Elba. Besides, the correspondence
kept up by him with his adherents in
France gave him hopes of regaining his former power,
which were, for a short time, fully realized. Napoleon
Bonaparte landed at Cannes, in Provence, on the 1st
of March 1815, with a small body of men, and on the
20th of that month entered Paris at the head of an
army which had joined him on the road. This could not
be matter of wonder, for the officers and soldiers had
won their fame under his command, and gladly welcomed
their former leader, under whom they probably
expected to acquire fresh honors, which might cancel
the memory of the defeats sustained in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Louis XVIII., unable to stem the torrent, withdrew
from Paris to Ghent, and Napoleon resumed his former
dignity of Emperor of the French. This assumption
the allied powers determined not to acknowledge, and
resolved to deprive him of his sovereignty, and again
restore the ancient dynasty.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, in consequence
of these occurrences, proceeded to the Downs,
and was there transhipped into small craft, which conveyed
it to Ostend, where it disembarked on the 22d
of April.</p>

<p>The battalion next proceeded to Ghent, and, after
remaining there a week, marched to Leuze, between
Ath and Tournay, and was subsequently placed in the
light brigade with the first battalion of the fifty-second,
six companies of the second and two companies of the
third battalion of the ninety-fifth regiment (Rifles), under
the command of Major-General Frederick Adam,
in the division of Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Brevet Colonel Reynell, afterwards Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Reynell, commanded the battalion at this period.</p>

<p>Napoleon resolved on attacking the Allies before
their forces had been fully collected, and by well-masked
and admirably combined movements, a portion
of his army was concentrated on the 14th of June
between the Sambre and the Meuse.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of June, as the battalion
was proceeding to the usual exercising ground of the
brigade at Leuze, it received orders for an immediate
advance upon <em>Nivelles</em>, where it arrived late that night.
On the same day Prince Blucher had been attacked at
<em>Ligny</em>, and was forced to retreat to Wavre. The Duke
of Wellington and a portion of his army had been
also attacked at <em>Quatre Bras</em> by Marshal Ney, who,
however, made no impression upon the British position.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning of the 17th of June,
the Duke of Wellington made a retrograde movement
upon <em>Waterloo</em>, in order to keep up his communication
with the Prussians. At day-break on the same morning,
the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> retired,
and broke up its position, with the rest of the allied
army, on the plains in the neighbourhood of <em>Waterloo</em>,
being situated to the left and rear of <em>Hougomont</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, with the rest of the army, bivouacked
in position during the night of the 17th of
June, drenched by the rain, which fell heavily. Upon
the morning of the memorable 18th of June, the battalion
stood in open column, and in this situation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
exposed for some time to a heavy fire of artillery, but
a judicious movement to a short distance alleviated in a
great measure this annoyance. Line was next formed,
and about two o’clock the battalion, with the rest of the
brigade, advanced, met their opponents in position,
charged, and instantly overthrew them.</p>

<p>A heavy fire now commenced upon the retreating
enemy, but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alignement</i> having been completely deranged
by the impetuosity of the advance, Colonel
Reynell, with his usual coolness, proceeded to restore
order, and had just completed the dressing of the
line when the French cavalry were seen advancing.
Square was instantly formed, and the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
with the rest of the brigade, sustained a charge
from three regiments of French cavalry, namely, one
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuirassiers</i>, one of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grenadiers-à-cheval</i>, and one of
lancers.</p>

<p>The charge was made with the most obstinate
bravery, but nothing could overcome the steadiness
of the British infantry, and after a destructive loss, the
French were forced to retire.</p>

<p>Previously to this advance, the square of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was struck by a round-shot, which
killed or wounded an officer and eighteen men of the
eighth company.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock in the evening the left wing
of the battalion was formed in rear of the right, and,
while thus placed, was, with the rest of the division,
attacked by a column of the Imperial Guard. These
troops were fresh, having been kept in reserve during
the day. They were allowed to approach close without
molestation, and the regiments throwing in a close and
well-directed fire, they could not deploy, but broke,
and retired in confusion.</p>

<p>The enemy having now exhausted all his efforts, the
British, in their turn, advanced. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
in the first instance, suffered much from the fire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
some guns that raked their front; these were soon
silenced, and the battalion was afterwards left unmolested.
In this advance the light brigade captured
several guns. Night closed in fast, and the corps rested
after this lengthened and sanguinary encounter, the
pursuit of the discomfited enemy being committed to
the Prussians, under Marshal Blucher, who had arrived
on the field of battle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> had Brevet Major Edmund
L’Estrange (Aide-de-Camp to Major-General Sir Denis
Pack, K.C.B.), and Ensign John Todd, killed. The following
officers were wounded: the Lieut.-Colonel
commanding the battalion, Colonel Thomas Reynell;
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Arthur Jones; Captains Samuel
Reed, Donald Campbell, William Alexander Grant,
James Henderson, and Brevet-Major Charles Johnstone;
Lieutenants Joseph Barrallier, Robert Lind, John
Roberts, James Coates, Robert Law, Carique Lewin,
and Lieutenant and Adjutant William Anderson.</p>

<p>The number of serjeants, buglers, and rank and file
killed amounted to twenty-nine; one hundred and sixty-six
were wounded, and thirty-six died of their wounds.</p>

<p>Both Houses of Parliament, with the greatest enthusiasm,
voted their thanks to the army “for its distinguished
valour at Waterloo.”</p>

<p>For the share which the battalion had in this glorious
victory, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> were permitted to bear,
in common with the rest of the army engaged upon the
18th of June, the word “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The officers and men engaged were presented with
silver medals by His Royal Highness the Prince Regent,
and were allowed to reckon two years additional service.</p>

<p>The battalion, with the rest of the army, afterwards
marched towards Paris, and entered that city on the
7th of July. The brigade encamped that day in the
<em>Champs Elysées</em>, near the Place Louis Quinze, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the only British troops quartered within the barriers,
and continued there until the beginning of November,
when it proceeded to Versailles, and to Viarmes in
December.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Louis XVIII. had entered Paris, and
was again reinstated on the throne of his ancestors.
Napoleon Bonaparte had surrendered to Captain Maitland,
commanding the “Bellerophon” British ship of
war, and the island of St. Helena having been fixed for
his residence, he was conveyed thither with a few of his
devoted followers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="fs70">2d bat.</span></div>

<p>On the 24th of December 1815, the second battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> was disbanded at Glasgow, the
effective officers and men being transferred to the first
battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816.</div>

<p>In January 1816, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> marched to
the Pas-de-Calais, in which part of France the regiment
was cantoned in several villages, having its head-quarters
at Norrent Fonte, a village on the high road from
Calais to Douay.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June 1816, the regiment assembled
upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bruyère</i> of Rombly, between the villages of
Lingham and Rombly on the one side, and Viterness
and Leitre on the other, for the purpose of receiving
the medals which had been granted by His Royal
Highness the Prince Regent to the officers, non-commissioned
officers, buglers, and privates, for their services
at the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>A hollow square upon the centre was formed on this
occasion; the ranks were opened, and the boxes containing
the medals were placed within the square.
Colonel Reynell then addressed the regiment in the
following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad2">“<span class="smcap">Seventy-first!!</span></p>

<p>“The deep interest, which you will all give me
credit for feeling, in everything that affects the corps

exertions of the army of His Grace the Duke of
Wellington upon the field of Waterloo, when the

Napoleon, reputed to be the first captain of the age,
were not only paralyzed at the moment, but blasted
beyond the power of even a second struggle.</p>

<p>“To have participated in a contest crowned with
victory so decisive, and productive of consequences
that have diffused peace, security, and happiness
throughout Europe, may be to each of you a source
of honorable pride, as well as of gratitude to the
Omnipotent Arbiter of all human contests, who
preserved you in such peril, and without whose protecting
hand the battle belongs not to the strong, nor
the race to the swift.</p>

<p>“I acknowledge to feel an honest, and, I trust, an
excusable, exultation, in having had the honor to
command you on that day; and in dispensing these
medals, destined to record in your families the share
you had in the ever memorable battle of <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>,
it is a peculiar satisfaction to me that I can present
them to those by whom they have been fairly and
honorably earned, and that I can here solemnly
declare, that in the course of that eventful day I did
not observe a soldier of this good regiment whose
conduct was not only creditable to the English
nation, but such as his dearest friends could desire.</p>

<p>“Under such agreeable reflections, I request you
to accept these medals, and to wear them with
becoming pride, as they are incontestable proofs of a
faithful discharge of your duty to your King and
your Country. I trust that they will act as powerful
talismans, to keep you, in your future lives, in the
paths of honor, sobriety, and virtue.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the above address the arms
were presented, “God save the King” was played, and
the battalion, by signal, gave three cheers. Colonel
Reynell then, from the lists of companies in succession,
called over the names of those entitled to receive a
medal, and with his own hand placed it in that of the
soldier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817.</div>

<p>New colours were presented to the regiment on the
13th of January 1817, by Major-General Sir Denis
Pack, K.C.B., who made the following address on the
occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad2">“<span class="smcap">Seventy-first Regiment!</span></p>

<p>“Officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, it
affords me the greatest satisfaction, at the request of
your commanding officer, Colonel Reynell, to have
the honor of presenting these colours to you.</p>

<p>“There are many who could perform the office with
a better grace, but there is no one, believe me, who is
more sensible of the merit of the corps, or who is
more anxious for its honor and welfare.</p>

<p>“I might justly pay to the valour and good conduct
of those present the compliments usual on such occasions,
but I had rather offer the expression of my
regard and admiration of that excellent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit-de-corps</i>
and real worth which a ten years’ intimate
knowledge of the regiment has taught me so highly
to appreciate. I shall always look back with pleasure
to that long period in which I had the good fortune
to be your commanding officer, and during which
time I received from the officers the most cordial and
zealous assistance in support of discipline; from the
non-commissioned officers proofs of the most disinterested
regard for His Majesty’s service and the
welfare of their regiment, and I witnessed on the
part of the privates and the corps at large a fidelity
to their colours in South America, as remarkable
under such trying circumstances as their valour has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
at all times been conspicuous in the field. I am
most happy to think that there is no drawback to the
pleasure all should feel on this occasion. Your
former colours were mislaid after a fête given in
London, to celebrate the Duke of Wellington’s
return after his glorious termination of the peninsular
war, and your colonel, General Francis Dundas,
has sent you three very handsome ones to replace
them.</p>

<p>“On them are emblazoned some of His Grace’s victories,
in which the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> bore a most
distinguished part, and more might be enumerated
which the corps may well be proud of. There are
still in your ranks valuable officers who have witnessed
the early glories of the regiment in the East,
and its splendid career since is fresh in the memory
of all. Never, indeed, did the character of the corps
stand higher; never was the fame of the British
arms or the glory of the British empire more pre-eminent
than at this moment, an enthusiastic recollection
of which the sight of these colours must
always inspire.</p>

<p>“While you have your present commanding officer
to lead you, it is unnecessary for me to add anything
to excite such a spirit; but was I called upon
to do so, I should have only to hold up the example
of those who have fallen in your ranks, and, above all,
point to the memory of that hero who so gloriously
fell at your head.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1818.</div>

<p>The regiment formed part of the “Army of Occupation”
in France until towards the end of October 1818,
when it embarked at Calais for England, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'arrived Dover'">arrived
at Dover</ins> on the 29th of that month.</p>

<p>After landing, the regiment proceeded immediately
to Chelmsford, where it remained for a short time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
During its stay at this place the establishment was
reduced from 810 to 650 rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November the regiment marched to
Weedon, Derby, and Nottingham, having its head-quarters
at the former place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819.</div>

<p>The regiment was inspected at Weedon on the 1st
of May 1819, by Major-General Sir John Byng, who
reported most favourably to His Royal Highness the
Commander-in-Chief upon its appearance and discipline.
In consequence of this report His Royal Highness was
pleased to dispense with any further inspection of the
regiment during the year.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June 1819, the regiment marched
to Chester, having detachments at Liverpool and the
Isle of Man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820.</div>

<p>In June 1820, the regiment marched to Rochdale,
Blackburn, and Burnley. In July following it proceeded
to Hertford, Ware, Hoddesdon, and Hatfield;
and on the 20th of November it was removed to
Canterbury.</p>

<p>Previously to the departure of the regiment from
Hertford, it was inspected by the Adjutant-General to
the Forces, Major-General Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B.,
who communicated to Colonel Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B., commanding the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, the
expression of the satisfaction experienced by His Royal
Highness the Commander-in-Chief in perusing the
report made on that occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821.</div>

<p>In June 1821, the regiment marched to Chatham,
having detachments at Sheerness, Tilbury Fort, and
Harwich. Here a further reduction took place of two
companies, making the establishment to consist of 576
rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822.</div>

<p>From Chatham the regiment marched to London,
and proceeded by the canal to Liverpool, there to
embark for Dublin, where it arrived on the 3d of May
1822; the regiment remained in that city until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
beginning of October, when it marched to the south of
Ireland. The head-quarters were stationed at Fermoy,
and detachments proceeded to the villages of Ballahooly,
Castletown Roche, Kilworth, Kildorrory, Wattstown,
Glanworth, and Mitchelstown. A subaltern’s party
was also encamped at Glennasheen in the county of
Limerick, the disturbed state of that part of Ireland
requiring detachments in the above posts, and the
utmost exertions of every individual for their protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824.</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Gordon Drummond, G.C.B., was
removed from the colonelcy of the eighty-eighth to
that of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment on the 16th of
January 1824, in succession to General Francis Dundas,
deceased.</p>

<p>The regiment remained here for two winters, and in
the beginning of May 1824 orders were received to
march to the Cove of Cork, to embark for foreign
service.</p>

<p>Before the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> marched to the coast
for embarkation, very gratifying addresses were presented
to Colonel Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, commanding
the regiment, from the magistrates and inhabitants of
the district round Fermoy, conveying their approbation
of the conduct of the corps, which had won the esteem
of all classes.</p>

<p>A very gratifying order was also issued by Major-General
Sir John Lambert, K.C.B., commanding the
south-western district of Ireland, relative to the conduct
of the regiment.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked for North America on the
14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th of May 1824, on board the
Indian trader Prince of Orange, Cato and Fanny
transports, and anchored at Quebec on the 23d, 24th,
and 25th of June.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825.</div>

<p>In the year 1825, the establishment of the regiment
was augmented from eight to ten companies, and formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
into six <em>service</em> and four <em>depôt</em> companies, consisting of
forty-two sergeants, fourteen buglers, and 740 rank
and file.</p>

<p>In consequence of this arrangement, the officers and
non-commissioned officers of two companies were
sent to England to join the depôt companies at
Chichester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826.</div>

<p>The detachments stationed during the summer months
at the posts of Sorel and Three Rivers rejoined the
head-quarters of the regiment at Quebec on the 15th
of October.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October and the 4th of November,
the service companies were inspected by Lieut.-General
the Earl of Dalhousie, the Commander of the Forces in
British North America, who expressed his fullest approbation
of their discipline and interior economy, as well
as of their conduct and appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827.</div>

<p>The head-quarter division of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
embarked at Quebec for Montreal on the 17th of May
1827, after having been stationed in that garrison nearly
three years. Preparatory to this change of quarters,
the service companies were again inspected by Lieut.-General
the Earl of Dalhousie, who, in orders, assured
Lieut.-Colonel Jones that he had never seen any regiment
in more perfect order.</p>

<p>The service companies arrived at Montreal on the
19th of May, and detachments from them were stationed
at Isle-aux-Noix, St. John’s, William Henry,
La Chine, Coteau-du-Lac, and Rideau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828.</div>

<p>On the 8th of May 1828, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
embarked for Kingston in batteaux, and arrived there
on the 16th of that month.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> remained stationed here for
twelve months. During the summer and part of the
autumn they suffered much from fever and ague,
having had at one period nearly a third of the men in
hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1829.</div>

<p>Upon the 1st of June 1829, the head-quarters embarked

<p>One company was detached to Niagara, another to
Amherstburg, and a third to Penetanguishene on Lake
Huron. A small number of men occupied the naval
post at Grand River on Lake Erie. The <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
occupied these posts for a period of two years.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August 1829, the depôt companies
embarked at Gravesend for Berwick-on-Tweed.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B., was

signal posts at Gibbs Hill and Mount Langton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833.</div>

<p>During the years 1832 and 1833, the service companies

regiment was ordered to be divided into two battalions,
the six service companies being termed the first battalion,
and the depôt, augmented by two new companies,
being styled the reserve battalion. The depôt
was accordingly moved from Stirling to Chichester in
1842, and after receiving one hundred and eighty
volunteers from other corps, was there organised into
a battalion for foreign service.</p>

<p>The reserve battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, under

the honor, when a subaltern, of witnessing the exploits of General
Wolfe upon the plains of Quebec, and was now at the head of our
grenadier company; but, having exerted himself too much upon the
march to Conjeveran, he was seized at that place with a fever, which
disabling him from conducting the grenadiers upon the detachment
under Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher, affected his mind so deeply, particularly
when he heard of their dismal fate, that a delirium came on during
this march, of which he died, regretted and justly lamented by all.”</p></div>

consequence of a <em>good hope</em> being entertained of discovering the long-wished
for passage to India, which ten years afterwards was realised by
Vasco de Gama, who doubled the Cape, and continued the voyage to the
Malabar coast. For more than a century the Cape continued as a temporary
rendezvous for European mariners. In July 1620, Humphrey
Fitzherbert and Andrew Shillinge, two of the East India Company’s
commanders, took formal possession of the place, in the name of King
James I., but no settlement was formed. In 1650 the government of
the Netherlands resolved to colonize the Cape, which remained in possession
of the Dutch until July 1795, when it was taken by the British
for the Prince of Orange, but was restored to its former possessors by
the Peace of Amiens, concluded in 1802. It was again captured by
the British in 1806, in whose possession it has since remained.</p></div>

<p class="smcap center">John Lord Macleod,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 19th December 1777</em>.</p>

<p>Lord John Macleod was the eldest son of the Earl of
Cromartie, and, with his father, was engaged in the attempt
made in 1745 by Prince Charles Edward, the young pretender,
to recover the throne of his ancestors. After the
battle of Culloden, in 1746, the Earl of Cromartie was
brought to trial, and pleaded guilty; but his life was spared
on consideration of the remorse expressed by him for having
been seduced in an unguarded moment from that loyalty
which he had always, previously to the breaking out of the
rebellion, evinced to the existing establishment, both in
Church and State. Lord Macleod also received the royal
mercy on account of his youth, and his regard for his parent,
which had been the cause of his being concerned in the
rebellion. The young lord also promised, that, should the
royal clemency be extended to him, that his future life and
fortune should be entirely devoted to His Majesty’s service,
which promise was amply fulfilled in after years. Lord
Macleod subsequently entered into the Swedish army, where
he served for several years with great reputation, and was
made a Commandant of the Order of the Sword in the kingdom
of Sweden. While the American war of independence
was being carried on, his Lordship returned to Great Britain,
and in December 1777 received authority to raise a regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of Highlanders, which was, on its formation, numbered
the seventy-third, and subsequently the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment, under the circumstances detailed in the Historical
Record. His Lordship was appointed colonel of the newly
raised regiment, to which a second battalion was added in
September 1778, and embarked with the first battalion for
India in January 1779, arriving at Madras in January
1780. The war with Hyder Ali, the powerful Sultan of
the Mysore territory, commenced in that year, and his Lordship
served under Major-General Sir Hector Munro in the
first instance, and afterwards under Lieut.-General Sir Eyre
Coote. On the 1st of June 1781, Colonel Lord Macleod
was promoted to the local rank of major-general in the East
Indies, in which year he returned to England, some misunderstanding
having arisen between his Lordship and
Major-General Stuart concerning priority of rank. His
Lordship was promoted to the rank of major-general on the
20th of November 1782. On the forfeited estates being
restored, in 1784, Major-General Lord Macleod obtained the
family estate of Cromartie. His decease occurred on the 2d
of April 1789, at Edinburgh.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">The Honorable William Gordon,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 9th April 1789</em>.</p>

<p>The Honorable William Gordon was appointed captain
in the Sixteenth Light Dragoons, when that corps was
raised in the year 1759. In October 1762, he was appointed
Lieut.-Colonel of the 105th regiment, and in 1777, he was
promoted to the colonelcy of the eighty-first regiment, which
was afterwards disbanded. In 1781 he was promoted to
the rank of major-general, and in April 1789 was nominated
colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> Highlanders. He was
advanced to the rank of lieut.-general in 1793, to that of
general in 1798, and was removed to the Twenty-first
Royal North British Fusiliers in 1803. He died in 1816.</p>

<p class="p2 smcap center">Sir John Francis Cradock, G.C.B. and K.C.,</p>

<p class="center">afterwards</p>

<p class="smcap center">Lord Howden,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 6th August 1803</em>.</p>

<p>This officer entered the army on the 15th of December
1777, as a cornet in the fourth regiment of horse, now the
seventh dragoon guards; and on the 9th of July 1779, he
exchanged to an ensigncy in the Coldstream guards, in
which he was promoted to a lieutenancy, with the rank of
captain, on the 12th of December 1781. On the 25th of
June 1785, he was advanced to the rank of major of the
twelfth dragoons, and on the 16th of September 1786, exchanged
into the thirteenth foot, of which regiment he was
appointed lieut.-colonel on the 16th of June 1789. Lieut.-Colonel
Cradock commanded the thirteenth regiment in the
West Indies, and on his return, in 1792, was appointed
quartermaster-general in Ireland, where he was specially
employed by Government in many of the disturbed counties.
He went a second time to the West Indies, in the command
of the second battalion of grenadiers, under the orders of
General Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, and was present
at the reduction of Martinique (where he was wounded),
St. Lucia, Guadaloupe, and at the siege of Fort Bourbon.
Before the reduction of the second battalion of grenadiers in
the West Indies he was appointed by Sir Charles Grey to
be his aide-de-camp, and on his return to England he
received the thanks of Parliament for his services.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February 1795, Lieut.-Colonel Cradock
received the brevet rank of colonel, and on the 16th of
April following was appointed colonel of the one hundred
and twenty-seventh regiment, which was disbanded in 1798,
when he was placed on half pay.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 1798, Colonel Cradock was
advanced to the rank of major-general, and served as
quartermaster-general in Ireland during the rebellion of
that year; was under the command of Lieut.-General Gerard
(afterwards Viscount) Lake at the affair with the rebels at
Vinegar Hill, and in the subsequent movements in the
county of Wexford. Major-General Cradock accompanied
Earl Cornwallis as quartermaster-general in his lordship’s
march against the French forces that landed in Killala<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
under General Humbert, and was severely wounded in the
action at Ballynahinch, when the French and rebel force
were defeated, and laid down their arms.</p>

<p>Major-General Cradock was afterwards appointed to the
staff of the Mediterranean, under General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
and proceeded on the expedition to Egypt, and was
in the actions of the 8th, 13th, and 21st of March 1801.
In that of the 13th, near Alexandria, he commanded the
brigades which formed the advance against the enemy, and
received the thanks of Sir Ralph Abercromby. He was
second in command of the division of the army that proceeded
to Cairo under the command of Lieut.-General
Hutchinson (afterwards the Earl of Donoughmore), and
was at the action of Rhamanie on the 9th of May 1801, and
at the surrender of Cairo and Alexandria. The surrender of
the latter place on the 2d of September following, terminated
the campaign, after which he was appointed to the
command of a force of 4,000 men, to proceed to Corfu; but
the preliminaries of peace being signed on the 1st of October
between Great Britain and France, put an end to the expedition,
and he returned to England, when he was again
honored with the thanks of Parliament. The Grand
Seignior had also established the order of knighthood of the
Crescent, of which the general officers who served in Egypt
were made members.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May 1801, Major-General Cradock had
been appointed colonel commandant of the fifty-fourth regiment,
and upon the reduction of the army, in 1802, he was
placed on half-pay. On the 6th of August 1803, he was
appointed colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 1805, Major-General Sir John
Cradock, K.B., was advanced to the rank of lieut.-general,
and appointed to the command of the forces at Madras.
Upon the departure from India of General Lord Lake, in
1806, Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock remained for nearly
a year in the command of the forces in that country. In
1808 he was appointed to command the forces in Portugal,
during the critical period preceding the arrival of Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, and was afterwards appointed
Governor of Gibraltar, which in a short time he resigned.
On the 6th of January 1809, he was removed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> to the colonelcy of the forty-third regiment.
In 1811 he was appointed governor of the Cape of Good
Hope, and commander of the forces on that station, which
he held until 1814, on the 4th of June of which year he was
promoted to the rank of general.</p>

<p>General Sir John Cradock was nominated a Knight Grand
Cross of the Order of the Bath on the 2d of January 1815,
and in 1819 was created a peer of Ireland, by the title of
Baron Howden. At the coronation of His Majesty King
William IV. he was advanced to the dignity of a Peer of the
United Kingdom. By royal licence he afterwards altered
his name to Caradoc, deeming that to be the ancient and
veritable orthography. The decease of General the Right
Honorable John Francis Caradoc, Baron Howden of Howden
and Grimstone in the county of York, and of Cradockstown,
county of Kildare, occurred on the 26th of July 1839,
at the advanced age of eighty years.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">Francis Dundas,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 7th January 1809.</em></p>

<p>The first commission of this officer was an ensigncy in the
first foot guards, dated 4th of April 1775, and in May 1777
he joined the army in North America, was present at the
battle of Brandywine on the 11th of September of that
year, and in that of Germantown on the 4th of October
following, also at the siege of ten forts on the river Delaware,
and after their reduction in December the detachment
of guards employed on that service rejoined the army,
and went into winter quarters at Philadelphia. On the
23d of January 1778 he received a lieutenancy, with the
rank of captain, in the first foot guards. Captain Dundas
served the campaign of that year, and was present in the
action of Monmouth Court-House on the 28th of June 1778,
fought during the march of the British army from Philadelphia
to New York, in which the second battalion of the
first foot guards was principally engaged. Having soon
after been appointed to the light company of that corps,
he was employed on various detached services in 1778 and
1779, in the course of which the company to which he
belonged sustained considerable losses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The corps of guards being detached into South Carolina,
joined the army under Lieut.-General the Earl Cornwallis,
in 1780, and the light company forming his lordship’s
advanced guard, it was almost every day engaged. Captain
Dundas commanded it at the battle of Guildford and at
York Town.</p>

<p>Captain Dundas was promoted to a company in the
first foot guards, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, on the
11th of April 1783, and on the 6th of June following
exchanged into the forty-fifth regiment, from which he was
transferred to the first foot on the 31st of March 1787.
With the first battalion of the latter regiment Lieut.-Colonel
Dundas embarked for Jamaica in January 1790, and returned
to England in July 1791. In October 1793 he was
appointed aide-de-camp to King George III., and received
the brevet rank of colonel.</p>

<p>Colonel Dundas was employed in that rank in the West
Indies as adjutant-general to the army under General Sir
Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, and was present at the
siege of Martinique and the other adjacent islands in 1794.
Upon his return to England, being appointed on the 9th of
October 1794, colonel of the Scots brigade, afterwards numbered
the ninety-fourth regiment, he joined it in Scotland,
and raised a new battalion.</p>

<p>Major-General Dundas, to which rank he was advanced
on the 26th of February 1795, was employed on the staff in
North Britain until ordered to join the army preparing
for foreign service under Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
at Southampton. Having returned to Portsmouth
with the expedition, he was soon afterwards appointed to
the command at the Cape of Good Hope, and in August
1796 he embarked for that colony. Being appointed lieut.-governor,
with the command of the troops under the
governor, he continued to hold that appointment until
Lord Macartney returned to England in November 1798,
leaving him to act as civil governor. Upon the arrival of
Lord Macartney’s successor, in December 1799, Major-General
Dundas resumed his former situation; but that
officer being recalled in 1801, the civil with the military
authority again devolved on Major-General Dundas, and he
held both until the Cape was restored to the Dutch by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
treaty of peace concluded in 1803. Upon his return to
England in June 1803, Lieut.-General Dundas, to which
rank he had been promoted on the 29th of April of the previous
year, was placed on the staff in the southern district
of Great Britain, under General Sir David Dundas, K.B.
Towards the end of 1805 Lieut.-General Dundas was
appointed to the command of a division ordered to join the
army assembling in Hanover under Lieut.-General Lord
Cathcart, and on his return, in 1806, he was again appointed
to the staff in the southern district. On the 7th of January
1809, Lieut.-General Dundas was appointed by His Majesty
to be colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, and on the
1st of January 1812 was advanced to the rank of general.
He had been appointed governor of Carrickfergus in
Ireland in 1787, and was transferred in January 1817 to
the governorship of Dumbarton Castle in Scotland.</p>

<p>The decease of General Dundas occurred at Edinburgh
on the 16th of January 1824.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">Sir Gordon Drummond, G.C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 16th January 1824.</em></p>

<p>Removed to the forty-ninth regiment on the 21st of September
1829, and to the eighth foot on the 24th of April 1846.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 21st September 1829.</em></p>

<p>Removed to the thirty-first regiment on the 28th of
March 1838, and to the forty-fifth regiment on the 12th of
July 1847.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 28th March 1838.</em></p>

<p>This officer was appointed ensign in the sixty-sixth regiment
on the 20th of January 1803, lieutenant in the ninth foot
on the 25th of February, and was removed to the first life
guards on the 10th of March of the same year. On the 14th
of February 1805 he was promoted to the rank of captain in
the twenty-eighth regiment, and was removed to the thirteenth
light dragoons on the 13th of June following, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in 1809 was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general
in the army in the Peninsula under Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley. In March 1810, Captain Whittingham
was promoted to the rank of major, serving with the Portuguese
army. He was subsequently employed in America;
but the chief scene of his services was with the army in
Spain, for which he was peculiarly qualified by his perfect
knowledge of the Spanish language. He was first permitted
to join that service as aide-de-camp to General Castanos, and
in that capacity shared in the battle and victory of Baylen.
Major Whittingham afterwards served under the Duke of
Albuquerque, and was severely wounded at Talavera. Soon
afterwards he obtained the command of the Spanish cavalry,
and was present at the battle of Barrosa, fought on the 5th
of March 1811. On the 30th of May following he was promoted
lieut.-colonel in the Portuguese army. He was next
intrusted to raise and command a large corps of Spanish
troops clothed and paid by the British Government. In
1812, as major-general in command of this well-disciplined
corps, he was, in junction with the British army at Alicant,
successfully opposed to Marshal Suchet, and was again
wounded at the battle of Castalla; after which he served
with distinction in command of a division of infantry under
Lieut.-General Sir John Murray, and subsequently under
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck on the eastern coast
of Spain.</p>

<p>At the restoration of peace in 1814, Lieut.-Colonel Whittingham
returned to England, his conduct in Spain being
reported in very flattering terms by the British ambassador
in Spain and by the Duke of Wellington. On the 4th of
June 1814, he was appointed aide-de-camp to His Royal
Highness the Prince Regent, with the rank of colonel in the
army; and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the
Bath, with the honor of knighthood, on the 4th of June 1815.</p>

<p>Upon the return of Napoleon from Elba in March 1815,
Colonel Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham returned to the
Peninsula, at the particular request of the King of Spain,
and on his arrival at Madrid, he was invested with the
Grand Cross of the Order of San Fernando. In the year
1819 he was appointed governor of Dominica, and in 1822
his services were transferred to India as quartermaster-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the king’s troops; he subsequently held the command
as major-general, to which rank he was promoted on
the 27th of May 1825, successively in the Cawnpoor and
Meerut divisions.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham served at
the siege of Bhurtpore, which was captured in January 1826;
and received the thanks of Parliament for his conduct on
that occasion. He was also nominated a Knight Commander
of the Order of the Bath on the 26th of December following.</p>

<p>Having returned from India in 1835, Major-General Sir
Samuel Ford Whittingham was appointed to the command
of the forces in the Windward and Leeward Islands in 1836.
On the 28th of March 1838, he was appointed colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> Regiment, and on the 28th of June following
was advanced to the rank of lieut.-general. He was permitted
to resign the Windward and Leeward command in
1839, in order to undertake the command-in-chief at Madras,
receiving at the same time from General Lord Hill, then
commanding-in-chief, a flattering testimonial of his services
while in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham arrived at
Madras on the 1st of August 1840, where he continued until
the 19th of January 1841, the date of his decease.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">Sir Thomas Reynell, Bart., K.C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 15th March 1841.</em></p>

<p>This distinguished officer commenced his military career as
an ensign in the thirty-eighth regiment, his commission being
dated the 30th of September 1793. He joined the regiment
in January 1794 at Belfast, and in April proceeded with it
to Flanders, where it formed part of the army commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of York. On arrival at
the seat of war, the thirty-eighth regiment was ordered to
join the corps under the Austrian General Count Clèrfait,
who commanded the troops in West Flanders, and it was
attached to the division under Major-General Hammerstein,
together with the eighth light dragoons and twelfth foot.
Ensign Reynell was present in the action on the heights of
Lincelles on the 18th of May, and at the battle of Hoglade
on the 13th of June 1794. He afterwards served with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
army under the Duke of York, and was in Nimeguen when
that town was besieged. On the 3d of December following,
when cantoned between the rivers Rhine and the Waal, he
was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the thirty-eighth
regiment. Lieutenant Reynell served during the winter
campaign of 1795, and retreat through Westphalia to the
Weser, and there embarked for England. He accompanied
the thirty-eighth regiment to the West Indies in May 1796,
and was present at the capture of the island of Trinidad in
the early part of 1797. On the 22d of July 1797 he was
promoted to a company in the second West India regiment,
and joined that corps at Grenada.</p>

<p>Captain Reynell quitted Grenada early in 1798, in consequence
of being appointed assistant adjutant-general at
St. Domingo, where he remained until that island was
evacuated by the British in September, when he returned to
England. In the beginning of 1799 he revisited St. Domingo,
as one of the suite of Brigadier-General the Honorable
Thomas Maitland, then employed in framing a commercial
treaty with the negro chief Toussaint L’Ouverture, who had
risen to the supreme authority at St. Domingo. When it was
concluded, Captain Reynell returned to England in July of
the same year.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August 1799 Captain Reynell was transferred
to a company in the fortieth regiment, with the first
battalion of which he embarked for the Helder in that
month, and joined the army, which was at first commanded
by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, and afterwards
by the Duke of York. Captain Reynell was present in the
action of the 10th of September; also in the battle of the
19th of September, when he was the only captain of the
first battalion of the fortieth regiment that was not killed or
wounded; he was also present in the subsequent battles of
the 2d and 6th of October. Captain Reynell, upon the
British army being withdrawn from Holland, re-embarked
with the first battalion of the fortieth regiment, and arrived
in England in November 1799.</p>

<p>In April 1800 Captain Reynell embarked with his regiment
for the Mediterranean, and went in the first instance
to Minorca, afterwards to Leghorn; returned to Minorca,
and proceeded with a large force under Lieut.-General Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Ralph Abercromby for the attack of Cadiz. Signals for
disembarking were made; but although the boats had actually
put off from the ships, a recall was ordered, in consequence
of the plague raging at Cadiz. After this he proceeded up
the Mediterranean again, and in November landed at Malta.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the fortieth regiment having been
allowed to volunteer their services in the expedition to
Egypt, Captain Reynell proceeded thither in command of
the light company (one of the four flank companies detached
under Colonel Brent Spencer), and was present in
the action at the landing on the 8th of March 1801. On
this occasion the flank companies of the fortieth were on
the right of the line, and were particularly noticed for the
gallant style in which they mounted the sand-hills immediately
where they landed. Captain Reynell was present in
the battle of the 13th of March, and commanded the right
out-piquet of the army, in the morning of the 21st of that
month, when the French attacked the British near Alexandria,
on which occasion General Sir Ralph Abercromby
was mortally wounded. Soon after Captain Reynell proceeded
with a small British corps and some Turkish battalions
to Rosetta, of which easy possession was taken. He
was present in an action at Rhamanie, and followed the
French to Grand Cairo, where that part of their army
capitulated; and returned as escort in charge of the French
troops to Rosetta; and after they had embarked he joined
the force under Major-General Sir Eyre Coote before
Alexandria. The surrender of Alexandria, on the 2d of
September 1801, terminated the campaign, for his services
in which he received the gold medal conferred by the Grand
Seignior on the several officers employed.</p>

<p>Captain Reynell was afterwards appointed aide-de-camp
to Major-General Cradock, who was ordered to proceed from
Egypt with a force of four thousand men to Corfu; but
while at sea counter-orders were received, and he proceeded
to Malta, and subsequently to England. In July 1804 he
embarked as aide-de-camp to Lieut.-General Sir John
Cradock, K.B., who had been appointed to the command of
the troops at Madras, and while on the passage, namely, the
3d of August 1804, he was promoted to the rank of major in
the fortieth regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th of March 1805 Major Reynell received the
brevet rank of lieut.-colonel, upon being appointed deputy
quartermaster-general to the King’s troops in the East Indies.
In July following he was appointed aide-de-camp to the
Marquis Cornwallis, governor-general of India, and accompanied
his lordship from Madras to Bengal, with whom he
remained until his lordship’s decease, at Ghazepore, in October
1805. Lieut.-Colonel Reynell returned to Madras immediately
afterwards, and was appointed military secretary
to the Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, the commander-in-chief
at that presidency. He officiated during several
months of the year 1806 as deputy adjutant-general in
India, in which country he remained until October 1807,
when he returned with Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock
to Europe, and arrived in England in April 1808.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Reynell resigned the appointment of deputy
quartermaster-general in India, and was brought on full
pay as major of the ninety-sixth regiment on the 5th May
1808, and on the 22d of September following was appointed
major in the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment.</p>

<p>In October 1808, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell embarked
as military secretary to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock,
who had been appointed to command the forces in Portugal,
and landed in November at Lisbon. He remained in Portugal
until April 1809, when Sir John Cradock was superseded in
the command of the forces in Portugal by Lieut.-General Sir
Arthur Wellesley. Lieut.-Colonel Reynell afterwards accompanied
Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock to Cadiz, Seville,
and Gibraltar, of which latter place Sir John Cradock was
appointed governor, and Lieut.-Colonel Reynell remained
there as military secretary until September, when he returned
to England.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Reynell joined the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment
at Brabourne-Lees Barracks in December 1809, immediately
after its return from Walcheren. In September
1810 he embarked at Deal with six companies of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment for Portugal, landed at Lisbon
towards the end of that month, marched soon after to Mafra,
and thence to Sobral, where the six companies joined the
army under Lieut.-General Viscount Wellington. In October
Lieut.-Colonel Reynell had the honor of being particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
mentioned by Viscount Wellington in his despatch,
containing an account of the repulse of the attack of the
French at Sobral on the 14th of that month. The British army
shortly afterwards retired to the lines of Torres Vedras, and
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell was appointed assistant
adjutant-general to the fourth division under Major-General
the Honorable George Lowry Cole.</p>

<p>Early in March 1811, the army of Marshal Massena
broke up from its entrenched position at Santarem, and
retreated to the northward. Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell
entered Santarem with the fourth division the day after
Marshal Massena had left it, and continued in the pursuit of
the French army to the Mondego. In the affair of Redinha
he had a horse killed under him. From Espinhal the fourth
division was ordered to retrograde, and recross the Tagus,
for the purpose of reinforcing Marshal Sir William Carr
Beresford. In 1811 he joined the Marshal at Portalegre,
and being the senior British assistant adjutant-general, was
directed to join Marshal Beresford’s head-quarters, and proceeded
with him to Campo Mayor, from which the enemy
retired; was also present at the capture of Olivença, and
subsequently accompanied the marshal to Zafra, between
which place and Llerena a smart skirmish occurred with the
enemy’s hussars. In May 1811, Lieut.-Colonel Reynell
returned to England from Lisbon with despatches from
Viscount Wellington.</p>

<p>In July 1811, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell embarked as
military secretary to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock,
K.B., who had been appointed governor and commander of
the forces at the Cape of Good Hope, where he arrived by
the end of September. On the 4th of June 1813, he received
the brevet rank of colonel; and on the 5th of August
1813, he was promoted lieut.-colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Henry Cadogan, who was mortally wounded in the battle
of Vittoria; in February following, being desirous of joining
the corps, Colonel Reynell resigned his staff situation at
the Cape, and proceeded to England, where he arrived in
May 1814. In July of that year he was appointed adjutant-general
to the force then preparing for service in America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
under Lieut.-General Lord Hill; but, other operations being
then in view, that appointment was cancelled.</p>

<p>Colonel Reynell took the command of the first battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment at Limerick in December
1814, and embarked with it from Cork in January of the
following year, as part of an expedition for North America;
but peace having been concluded with the United States,
and contrary winds having prevented the sailing of the
vessels, the destination of the battalion was changed. In
March Colonel Reynell received orders to proceed with his
battalion to the Downs, where, in the middle of April, it
was transhipped into small vessels, and sent immediately to
Ostend, to join the army forming in Flanders, in consequence
of Napoleon Bonaparte having returned from Elba to
France.</p>

<p>In the memorable battle of Waterloo, fought on the 18th
of June 1815, Colonel Reynell commanded the first battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, and was wounded in
the foot on that occasion. He afterwards succeeded to the
command of Major-General Adam’s brigade, consisting of
the first battalions of the fifty-second and <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>,
with six companies of the second, and two companies of the
third battalion of the ninety-fifth regiment, in consequence
of that officer being wounded. Colonel Reynell commanded
the light brigade in the several operations that took place
on the route to Paris, and entered that capital at the head
of the brigade on the 7th of July 1815, and encamped with
it in the <em>Champs Elysées</em>, being the only British troops
quartered within the barriers. In this year he was appointed
a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and received the
Cross of a Knight of the Austrian Military Order of Maria
Theresa, also a Cross of the fourth class of the Russian
Military Order of St. George.</p>

<p>Colonel Reynell remained with the “<em>Army of Occupation</em>”
in France until October 1818, when, after a grand
review of the united British, Danish, and Russian contingents
at Valenciennes, the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> marched to Calais, and
embarked for England. Colonel Reynell continued in command
of the regiment until the 12th of August 1819, the
date of his promotion to the rank of major-general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>In April 1820 Major-General Reynell was suddenly
ordered to proceed to Glasgow, having been appointed to
the staff of North Britain as a major-general, in which
country he remained until March 1821, when, in consequence
of the tranquillity of Scotland, the extra general
officer was discontinued. Immediately afterwards he was
appointed to the staff of the East Indies, and directed to
proceed to Bombay, for which presidency he embarked in
September following, and where he arrived in March 1822.
After remaining there a month, Major-General Reynell was
removed to the staff of the Bengal Presidency, by order
of the Marquis of Hastings. In August Major-General
Reynell proceeded up the Ganges, and took the command of
the Meerut division on the 3d of December 1822.</p>

<p>The next operation of importance in which Major-General
Reynell was engaged was the siege of <em>Bhurtpore</em>. Early in
December 1825 a large force had been assembled for this purpose,
to the command of which he had been appointed, when,
just as the troops were about to move into the Bhurtpore
states, General Lord Combermere, the new commander-in-chief
in India, arrived from England, and Major-General
Reynell was then appointed to command the first division of
infantry. He commanded that division during the siege,
and directed the movements of the column of assault at the
north-east angle on the 18th of January 1826, when the
place was carried, and the citadel surrendered a few hours
after. For this service he was appointed a Knight Commander
of the Bath, as well as honored with the thanks of
both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Thomas Reynell succeeded to the baronetcy
upon the decease of his brother Sir Richard Littleton
Reynell in September 1829; and on the 30th of January 1832
was appointed by His Majesty King William IV. to be colonel
of the ninety-ninth regiment, from which he was removed to
the eighty-seventh Royal Irish fusiliers on the 15th of
August 1834. On the 10th of January 1837, he was promoted
to the rank of lieut.-general, and on the 14th of
June 1839 was appointed a member of the consolidated board
of general officers for the inspection and regulation of the
clothing of the army. On the 15th of March 1841, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
appointed by Her Majesty to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment. The decease of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas
Reynell, Bart., K.C.B., occurred at Avisford, near Arundel,
on the 10th of February 1848.</p>


<p class="p2 smcap center">Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th February 1848.</em></p>

<p>This officer entered the army as ensign in the twenty-ninth
regiment on the 23d of November 1794, and was promoted
lieutenant in the fortieth regiment on the 1st of May 1796.
He was advanced to the rank of captain in the eighth West
India regiment on the 25th of June 1798, and on the 26th of
May 1803 was appointed captain in the royal staff corps, and
on the 7th of April 1808 was promoted major in the fifth
West India regiment, in which year he joined the staff of the
army in the Peninsula, first as assistant adjutant-general,
and afterwards as assistant quartermaster-general. Major
Arbuthnot was present at the battles of Roleia, Vimiera, and

<p>On the 24th of May 1810, he received the rank of
lieutenant-colonel in the army, and was appointed deputy
quartermaster-general at the Cape of Good Hope, where he
arrived on the 25th March 1811. Lieut.-Colonel Arbuthnot
was appointed aide-de-camp to His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent on the 7th of February 1812, and in May
1813 proceeded from the Cape to the Peninsula, and was
present at the battles of the Pyrenees, Nivelle, and Orthes.
For these services in the Peninsula and south of France
he was decorated with a cross and one clasp. On the 24th
of March 1814, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Arbuthnot was appointed
lieutenant-colonel of the fifty-seventh regiment, and
on the 4th of June following received the brevet rank of colonel
in the army. In January 1815 he was nominated a Knight
Commander of the Bath, and on the 12th of August 1819
was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
regiment. On the 27th of May 1825 he attained the rank
of major-general, and on the 15th of August 1836 was
appointed colonel of the ninety-ninth regiment. Sir Thomas
Arbuthnot was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on the 28th of June 1838, and was removed to the fifty-second
regiment on the 23d of December 1839. In August
1842 he was appointed to the command of the northern and
midland districts of Great Britain, which he retained until
his decease. On the 7th of December 1844 Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Arbuthnot was removed from the fifty-second
to the ninth foot, and on the 18th of February 1848 was
appointed colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment. Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Arbuthnot, K.C.B., died at Salford,
near Manchester, on the 26th of January 1849.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Memoir of Captain</em> <span class="smcap">Philip Melvill</span> <em>of the</em> <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
<em>Regiment</em>.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>Captain Philip Melvill was the fourth and youngest son
of John Melvill, Esq., of Dunbar, and was born on the 7th of
April 1762. At the age of sixteen he obtained a commission,
on the 31st December 1777, as a lieutenant in the seventy-third
now the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, commanded by
Colonel John Lord Macleod, on condition of raising a
certain number of men, which, by the influence of his
relatives in the north of Scotland, he effected. Lieutenant
Melvill joined the regiment at Elgin, and was appointed
to the light company. In 1779 he embarked for India
with his regiment, and arrived at Madras in January 1780.
His services now became identical with those of Captain
Baird, under whose command he proceeded as part of a
reinforcement to Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, as detailed in the
foregoing pages. In the action on the 10th of September
1780, at Perambaukum, Lieutenant Melvill was severely
wounded in both arms; his left being broken, and, after
surrendering, the muscles of his right arm were cut in two
by a sabre. He was dashed unmercifully to the ground, and
as he lay exhausted, a horseman wounded him in the back
with his spear. In this miserable situation he continued
for two days and two nights, exposed to the intense heat of
a burning sun, and to the danger of being torn to pieces by
beasts of prey. He was afterwards conveyed to Hyder’s
camp, and was confined at Bangalore with the other prisoners.
After three years and a half of confinement, they
obtained their release in March 1784.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Melvill had been advanced to the rank of
captain on the 22d of June 1783; and being disabled from
military duty by the condition of his wounds, was, on being
released from captivity, enabled to visit his brother at
Bengal, where he remained until the beginning of the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
1786. Captain Melvill then returned to England, when
he was appointed, on the 3d of January 1787, to the
command of an invalid company stationed in Guernsey,
where he remained for five years. He subsequently exchanged
into a company at Portsmouth, and was afterwards
placed on the retired list, in consequence of ill-health.
After remaining a year in retirement at Topsham, in
Devonshire, Captain Melvill, on the 29th of September
1796, exchanged his full pay as a retired captain for the
command of an invalid company stationed at Pendennis
Castle in Cornwall.</p>

<p>In the year 1797, when preparations were made by
France for invading Great Britain, Captain Melvill, who
had been appointed lieut.-governor of Pendennis Castle,
was mainly instrumental in forming a corps of volunteers,
which was subsequently retained, first as the Pendennis
Volunteer Artillery, and afterwards as a body of local
militia.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Governor Melvill died on the 27th October 1811,
aged forty-nine, and was interred in Falmouth Church.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Memoir of the services of General the Right Honorable
Sir David Baird, Bart., G.C.B. &amp; K.C., formerly
Lieut.-Colonel of the</em> <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> <em>Regiment</em>.</p>

<p>This celebrated commander commenced his military career
as an ensign in the second foot, his commission being dated
the 14th of December 1772. He joined the regiment at
Gibraltar in April 1773, and in 1775 returned with it to
England. In February 1778 he was promoted lieutenant
in the second foot, and on the 16th of December 1777 was
promoted to a company in the seventy third regiment, then
being raised by Colonel Lord Macleod, which was afterwards
numbered the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment. This corps Captain
Baird joined at Elgin, from whence he marched to Fort
George, and embarked for Guernsey. In January 1779 he
embarked with his regiment for India, and arrived at Madras
in January 1780. The regiment, shortly after its arrival
in India, was called upon to take part in the war against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Hyder Ali, the powerful sovereign of the Mysore, whose
army exceeded eighty thousand, besides a strong body under
a general of the name of Meer Saib, who had entered the
Company’s territories on the north. This force was rendered
still more formidable and effective by the aid of
Monsieur Lally’s troops, and a great number of French officers
who served his artillery, and even directed all his
marches and operations. The British army ready to oppose
this invasion did not consist of five thousand men. These
were commanded by Major-General Sir Hector Munro, K.B.,
and were stationed at St. Thomas’s Mount, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Madras, in order to cover that city. Here
they were joined by Colonel Lord Macleod and the seventy-third
regiment.</p>

<p>Hyder Ali, after a march across the country, which he
marked by fire and sword, suddenly turned upon Arcot, and
on the 21st of August 1780 sat down before that city, as the
first operation of the war. Arcot was the capital town of
the territory of the nabob of that name, the only prince in
India who was friendly and in alliance with the Company.
It contained immense stores of provisions, and, what was
equally wanted, a vast treasure of money. There was another
important reason, which required on the part of the British
an immediate attention to this movement. Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie, with a body of troops, was in the Northern Circars;
and Hyder Ali, by besieging Arcot, had interposed himself
between this detachment and the main army under Major-General
Sir Hector Munro. Orders were immediately sent
to Lieut.-Colonel Baillie to hasten to the Mount, to join the
main army; and Sir Hector Munro, at once to meet Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie and to raise the siege of Arcot, marched on
the 25th of August with his army for Conjeveram, a place
forty miles distant from Madras, in the Arcot road.</p>

<p>The British troops were followed during the whole way
by the enemy’s horse. They were four days on their march
to Conjeveram, and when they arrived, they found the whole
country under water, and no provisions of any kind to be
procured. So relax were the commissaries appointed by
the Madras government, that the army had but four days’
provisions; in the midst of the most fertile region of India,
and in the very onset and commencement of a war, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
troops were in danger of being famished. The army had no
other resource than to spread itself individually over the fields,
and, at the risk of being destroyed in detail by the enemy’s
horse, collect the growing rice, up to their knees in water.</p>

<p>Hyder Ali, as the British general foresaw, raised the
siege of Arcot upon this movement towards Conjeveram;
but, what he had not foreseen, his politic enemy threw his
army in such a manner across the only possible road of
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie’s detachment, as to prevent the desired
junction, which had been expected to have taken place on the
30th of August, the day after the arrival of the army at Conjeveram.
Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, before this last movement
of the enemy to cut him off, had been stopped for some days,
at no great distance, by the sudden rising of a small river.
Hyder made use of this time to throw his army between
them. On the 5th of September Lieut.-Colonel Baillie
effected his passage over the river, but Hyder, being informed
of it, made a second movement, which completely intercepted
him. In order in some degree, however, to defeat this
movement, but with slight hopes of success, Sir Hector
Munro changed his position likewise, and advanced about
two miles, to a high ground on the Tripassoor road, which
was the way that the expected detachment was to come.
By these movements the hostile camps were brought within
two miles of each other, the enemy lying about that distance
to the left of the British.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Baillie had passed the river in his way on
the afternoon of the 5th of September, and encamped for
the night. Hyder, on receiving this information, made the
movement before related, and other arrangements on the
following morning, the 6th of September, and Sir Hector
Munro changed his own position at the same time. This
change was scarcely effected when the evident bustle in the
enemy’s army explained its purpose. In fact the purport
of Hyder’s movement was to cover and support a great
attack at that moment making on Lieut.-Colonel Baillie’s
detachment. He had already sent his brother-in-law, Meer
Saib, with eight thousand horse upon that service, and
immediately afterwards detached his son, Tippoo Saib, with
six thousand infantry, eighteen thousand cavalry, and twelve
pieces of cannon, to join in a united and decisive attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
They encountered Lieut.-Colonel Baillie at a place called
Perambaukum, where he made the most masterly dispositions
to withstand this vast superiority of force. After an exceedingly
severe and well-fought action, of several hours’
continuance, the enemy was routed, and Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie gained as complete a victory as a total want of
cavalry and the smallness of his numbers could possibly
admit. Through these circumstances he lost his baggage.
His whole force did not exceed two thousand sepoys, and
from one to two companies of European artillery.</p>

<p>This success, however, by diminishing Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie’s force, only added to his distress. The British camp
was within a few miles, but Hyder’s army lay full in his
way, and he was, moreover, in the greatest want of provisions.
Under these circumstances, Lieut.-Colonel Baillie
despatched a messenger to Major-General Sir Hector Munro,
with an account of his situation, stating that he had sustained
a loss which rendered him incapable of advancing,
while his total want of provisions rendered it equally impossible
for him to remain in his present position. A
council of war being held, at which Colonel Lord Macleod
assisted, it was resolved to send a reinforcement to Lieut.-Colonel
Baillie, to enable him to push forward in despite of
the enemy. Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher, Captain Baird, and
other officers were sent off with a strong detachment to the
relief of Lieut.-Colonel Baillie. The main force of this
detachment consisted of the flank companies of the first
battalion of the <em>Seventy-third</em>, afterwards numbered the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, the light company being commanded
by Captain Baird. There were two other companies
of European grenadiers, one company of sepoy marksmen,
and ten companies of sepoy grenadiers. In all about a thousand
men. The junction was effected with some difficulty
on the 9th of September, and the following day was appointed
for the march of the united detachment. Accordingly, day-light
had scarcely broken when it commenced its march.
By seven o’clock in the morning of the 10th of September
the enemy poured down upon them in thousands. The
British fought with the greatest heroism, and at one time
victory seemed to be in their favour. But the tumbrils
containing the ammunition accidentally blew up with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
dreadful explosions in the centre of their lines. The
destruction of men was great, but the total loss of their
ammunition was still more fatal to the survivors. This
turned the fortune of the day, and after successive prodigies
of valour the brave sepoys were almost to a man cut to
pieces.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonels Baillie and Fletcher, assisted by Captain
Baird, made one more desperate effort. They rallied the
Europeans, and, under the fire of the whole of the immense
artillery of the enemy, gained a little eminence, and formed
themselves into a fresh square. In this form did this invincible
band, though totally without ammunition, the officers
fighting with their swords and the soldiers with their
bayonets, resist and repulse the myriads of the enemy in
thirteen different attacks, until at length, incapable of withstanding
the successive torrents of fresh troops which were
continually pouring upon them, they were fairly borne down
and trampled on, many of them still continuing to fight
under the legs of the horses and elephants.</p>

<p>The loss of the British in the action at Perambaukum was
of course great; and it is a reasonable subject of surprise
that any escaped. Lieut.-Colonel Fletcher was amongst
the slain. Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, Captain Baird, after being
severely wounded in four places, together with Captain the
Honorable John Lindsay, Lieutenant Philip Melvill, and
other officers, with two hundred Europeans, were made
prisoners. They were carried into the presence of Hyder,
who, with a true Asiatic barbarism, received them with the
most insolent triumph and ferocious pride. The British
officers, with a spirit worthy of their country, retorted his
pride by an indignant coolness and contempt. “Your son
will inform you,” said Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, appealing to
Tippoo, who was present, “that you owe the victory to our
disaster rather than to our defeat.” Hyder angrily ordered
them from his presence, and commanded them instantly to
prison, where they remained for three years and a half,
enduring great hardships, Captain Baird being chained by
the leg to another prisoner.</p>

<p>In March 1784 Captain Baird was released, and in July
joined his regiment at Arcot. In 1786 the <em>Seventy-third</em>
was directed to be numbered the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Captain Baird was promoted to the rank of major in the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment on the 5th of June 1787, and in
October obtained leave of absence, when he returned to
Great Britain. He was advanced to the lieut.-colonelcy
of the regiment on the 8th of December 1790, and in 1791
proceeded to India, and joined the army under General the
Earl Cornwallis. Lieut.-Colonel Baird commanded a brigade
of sepoys, and was present at the attack of a number
of droogs or hill forts; also at the siege of Seringapatam in
1791 and 1792; likewise at the storming of Tippoo’s lines
and camps on the island of Seringapatam. In 1793 the
Lieut.-Colonel commanded a brigade of Europeans, and was
present at the siege of Pondicherry. On the 21st of August
1795, he was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel, and in
October 1797 embarked at Madras with the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
for Europe, but on arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, in
January following, he was appointed brigadier-general, and
placed on that staff in command of a brigade. He was promoted
to the rank of major-general on the 18th of June
1798, and was removed to the staff in India. Major-General
Baird sailed from the Cape of Good Hope for Madras in
command of two regiments of infantry and the drafts of
the twenty-eighth dragoons, and arrived at his destination
in January 1799. On the 1st of February he joined the
army forming at Vellore for the attack of Seringapatam,
and commanded a brigade of Europeans. On the 4th of
May Major-General Baird commanded the storming party
with success, and, in consequence, was presented by the
army, through Lieut.-General, afterwards Lord Harris,
Commander-in-Chief, with Tippoo Sultan’s state sword, and
a dress sword from the field officers serving under his immediate
command. In 1800 he was removed to the Bengal
staff, and on the 9th of May of that year was appointed
colonel-commandant of the fifty-fourth, and colonel of that
regiment on the 8th of May 1801, in which year he was
appointed to command the forces which were sent from
India to Egypt, and arrived at Cosseir in June, afterwards
crossed the desert, and embarked on the Nile, arriving in
the following month at Grand Cairo. He joined the army
under Lieut.-General Sir John Hutchinson, afterwards the
Earl of Donoughmore, a few days before the surrender of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Alexandria, which capitulated on the 2d of September, and
terminated the campaign in Egypt.</p>

<p>In 1802 Major-General Baird returned across the desert
to India, and was removed to the Madras staff in 1803, and
commanded a large division of the army forming against
the Mahrattas. He marched into the Mysore country,
where the Commander-in-Chief, Lieut.-General James
Stuart, joined him, and afterwards arrived on the banks of
the river Jambudra, in command of the line. Major-General
Wellesley, the present Duke of Wellington, being appointed
to the command of the greater part of the army, Major-General
Baird proceeded into the Mahratta country, and
subsequently obtained permission to return to Great Britain.
He sailed in March with his staff from Madras, and was
taken prisoner by a French privateer. In October he was
re-taken as the ship was entering Corunna. He arrived in
England on the 3d of November, having given his parole
that he should consider himself as a prisoner of war; but
shortly after Major-General Baird and staff were exchanged
for the French General Morgan and his staff.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir David Baird, who had received the
honour of knighthood, was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general
on the 30th of October 1805, and commanded an
expedition against the Cape of Good Hope, where he arrived
on the 5th of January 1806, and effected a landing on the
following day. On the 8th, the Dutch army was defeated;
on the 10th, the castle and town of Cape Town surrendered;
and on the 18th, General Janssens surrendered the colony.
In 1807 Lieut.-General Sir David Baird returned to England,
and on the 19th of July of that year was removed from the
colonelcy of the fifty-fourth to that of the twenty-fourth
regiment. His next service was in the expedition to Copenhagen
under Lieut.-General Lord Cathcart, at the siege of
which he commanded a division, and was twice slightly
wounded. In 1808 Lieut.-General Sir David Baird was
placed on the staff in Ireland, and commanded the camp on
the Curragh of Kildare. In September of that year he
embarked at the Cove of Cork, in the command of a division,
consisting of about five thousand infantry, for Falmouth,
where he received reinforcements, and sailed in command of
about ten thousand men for Corunna, where he arrived in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
beginning of November, and formed a junction with the
army under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore. Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird commanded the first division of that army,
and in the battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January 1809,
he lost his left arm. Sir David Baird received the thanks
of both Houses of Parliament for his services at Corunna;
“an honor of which,” he remarked in his reply to the
House of Peers, “no one can be more fully sensible than
myself, having had the good fortune to be deemed worthy
of this eminent distinction on four several occasions;”
alluding to his name having been included in the votes of
thanks for the operations of the army in India in 1799, for
those of Egypt in 1801, and in the Danish expedition in
1807.</p>

<p>In testimony of the Royal approbation, Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird was created a baronet, by patent dated
13th April 1809, and was promoted to the rank of general
on the 4th of June 1814; on the 2d of January 1815 he
was nominated a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the
Bath, and was appointed governor of Kinsale on the 11th
of March 1819, and of Fort George, North Britain, on the
4th of December 1827. He was also a privy councillor for
Ireland. His decease occurred at his seat, Ferntower, in
Perthshire, on the 18th of August 1829.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Memoir of the services of Major-General Sir Denis Pack,
K.C.B. and C.T.S., formerly Lieut.-Colonel of the</em>
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> <em>regiment</em>.</p>

<p>This distinguished officer entered the army as a cornet in
the fourteenth light dragoons, his commission being dated
30th November 1791, and joined that regiment in Dublin in
January 1792. He served in Ireland, and was engaged in
quelling some disturbances, between that period and 1794,
when he embarked at Cork for the Continent, and landed
with the forces under Lieut.-General the Earl of Moira at
Ostend. After his lordship’s march from thence to form a
junction with the army under His Royal Highness the Duke
of York, Cornet Pack offered his services and was employed
to carry an important despatch to Nieuport, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
attempt he fortunately succeeded, and was thanked for it
by Major-General Richard Vyse. His commanding officer’s
squadron of the fourteenth light dragoons was destined,
after the embarkation at Ostend, to retreat to Nieuport,
which it effected by the advance of a corps from that place
to its support. Nieuport being almost immediately invested,
farther retreat from thence became extremely hazardous and
difficult. Cornet Pack was in a boat with about two
hundred emigrants, and did not gain the sea without a sharp
action and a severe loss. It conveyed the last of those who
escaped the horrors <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'which befel that'">which befell that</ins> ill-fated garrison. He
joined the Duke of York’s army near Antwerp, and was in
the action at Boxtel, and some partial affairs. He served
that severe winter campaign, and in 1795 returned to
England, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in the fourteenth
light dragoons on the 12th of March of that year.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pack subsequently embarked at Southampton
in command of a detachment of eighty dragoons destined
for Quiberon Bay. After the failure of the emigrants there,
he proceeded under the orders of Major-General Welbore
Ellis Doyle to the Isle de Dieu, where he landed, and
did duty for some months as field officer. In 1796, Lieutenant
Pack returned to England, and on the 27th February
of that year was promoted to the rank of captain in the
fifth dragoon guards, which regiment he accompanied to
Ireland, and was frequently engaged during the rebellion
in that country, and was noticed in a despatch dated 21st of
June 1798, from General the Marquis Cornwallis, K.G., on
the occasion of Captain Pack’s detachment defeating a party
of rebels, on the 19th of that month, between Rathangan
and Prosperous.</p>

<p>When the French landed a force in that country, Captain
Pack was specially employed by General the Marquis Cornwallis,
with a detached squadron, and after the surrender of
General Humbert he was appointed to command the escort
which was despatched in charge of him and the other
French generals to Dublin.</p>

<p>On the 25th of August 1798 Captain Pack was advanced
to the rank of major in the fourth royal Irish dragoon
guards, and embarked with his regiment in the expedition
to Holland, but was countermanded, and stationed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
England and Scotland until 1800, when he was promoted,
on the 6th of December of that year, to the rank of lieutenant-colonel
in the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment, and on the
24th of April 1801 joined that corps in Ireland, in which
country he served until August 1805, when he embarked at
Cork with the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment
in the expedition to the Cape of Good Hope under Major-General
Sir David Baird, and was engaged and severely
wounded in effecting the landing at the Cape on the 6th of
January 1806, but continued in the field, and was, on the
8th of January, in the action at Bleuberg. These operations
led to a treaty, which was signed on the 19th of the same
month, by which the Cape of Good Hope was surrendered
to Great Britain.</p>

<p>In April 1806 Lieut.-Colonel Pack proceeded, with the first
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>, in the expedition to South
America under the command of Brigadier-General William
Carr Beresford, afterwards General Viscount Beresford, and
was present in six actions with the enemy in that country,
and was wounded, and detained a prisoner, contrary to
the capitulation which restored the town of Buenos Ayres
to the Spaniards. Lieut.-Colonel Pack subsequently effected
his escape with Brigadier-General Beresford, and joined
the army at Monte Video, under Brigadier-General Sir
Samuel Auchmuty, who, at the request of Lieut.-Colonel
Pack, directed a board of naval and military officers to inquire
into the particulars of his escape, by whom it was unanimously
approved, and he was declared free to serve.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Lieut.-Colonel Pack was then detached with a small force
to Colonia, where he commanded successfully in two
actions; namely, in an attack on the enemy on his post,
and in one made on his, at St. Pedro, when, after a forced
night march, the troops under his orders, amounting to
1,013 rank and file, routed the enemy, on the 7th of June
1807, and captured a standard, together with 105 prisoners,
including one lieut.-colonel and five other officers; all his
artillery, baggage, &amp;c. were likewise taken.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Pack was shortly afterwards appointed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Lieut.-General John Whitelocke to the command of all the
light companies in his army, and joined the force then in
the River Plate destined to act against Buenos Ayres. He
was engaged in two successful actions with the enemy prior
to the unfortunate attack on the town, in which he was
three times wounded. Towards the end of 1807 he
returned to Europe, and early in 1808 had the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span>
completely re-equipped; and, proceeding with the
first battalion of the regiment from Cork to Portugal,
on the 17th of June following, in the expedition under
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, was present in the
battles of Roleia and Vimiera, on the 17th and 21st of
August 1808, which rescued Portugal from the French.
The conduct of the battalion and of Lieut.-Colonel Pack
was noticed in the public despatches, and the troops received
the thanks of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Pack afterwards marched into Spain, under
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, and was at the affair of
Lugo on the 5th of January 1809, and at the battle of
Corunna on the 16th of that month, after which he returned
to England, and embarked in July following for Holland,
under Lieut.-General the Earl of Chatham. On landing at
Walcheren, Lieut.-Colonel Pack was appointed to command
a small corps of cavalry and light infantry; was employed
in the siege of Flushing, and particularly named by Lieut.-General
Sir Eyre Coote for the command of a detachment
to storm an advanced work on the right of the enemy’s line.
These orders were successfully executed, the detachment
taking forty-nine prisoners, and spiking the guns, though
defended by five times the number of men under Lieut.-Colonel
Pack. After the surrender of Flushing he was
appointed commandant of Ter Veer, where he was dangerously
ill for a short period, but remained until the island
was evacuated, on which occasion, in conjunction with
Commodore Owen, he commanded the rear-guard of the
army.</p>

<p>Soon after the return of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> to England,
in December 1809, the battalion was prepared again for
active service; but the government did not consider the
men had sufficiently <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'recovered the effects'">recovered from the effects</ins> of the Walcheren
fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Pack, being extremely anxious to bear
a part in the momentous campaign about to commence in
the Peninsula, obtained His Majesty’s permission to proceed
to Portugal, and offer his services to Viscount Wellington
and Marshal Beresford. Both generals having decided that
he could not be more usefully employed than with the
Portuguese troops, he accepted an infantry brigade in that
service, and took the command of it just before the siege of
Ciudad Rodrigo by Marshal Massena, previously to his
invasion of Portugal.</p>

<p>On the 25th of July 1810 Lieut.-Colonel Pack was
appointed aide-de-camp to the king, with the rank of
colonel in the army. After the surrender of Ciudad Rodrigo,
of Almeida, and Marshal Massena’s passage of the
Coa, Colonel Pack’s brigade (an independent one) was
directed to take a separate route with a regiment of cavalry
attached to it, and remained in presence of the enemy’s
army at St. Combadoa, retiring slowly before it, on his
advance to the position at Busaco. The conduct of the
brigade was noticed in that battle, which was fought
on the 27th of September 1810. In the admirable retreat
afterwards to the lines of Lisbon, it formed, with the light
division and cavalry, the rear-guard of the allied army.
The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> having at that
period joined Viscount Wellington, Colonel Pack’s wish
was to have returned to the battalion, but by the desire of
both commanders-in-chief, he continued to serve in the
Portuguese army.</p>

<p>In 1811 the brigade was in the advance guard in following
the enemy up to his position at Santarem; was at the
out-posts there, and again in the advance on the further
retreat of the French from Portugal. It was employed in
the investment of Almeida, and in the operations against
Marshal Marmont, on his advance to the relief of Ciudad
Rodrigo in January 1812. At the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo
it bore a distinguished part. It marched to the siege of
Badajos, and was in active operations against the enemy on
his advance to the Tagus, and subsequent retreat from
Portugal. It moved in the advanced guard on the march
of the allies to Salamanca and the Douro. It suffered
severely in the battle of Salamanca on the 22d of July 1812.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The brigade was in the march to and capture of Madrid;
in the march to Burgos, and subsequent siege of that place.
Previously to the siege of Burgos, detachments under
Colonel Pack’s command carried by assault the horn-work
of that castle, after a desperate and gallant action, for which
the special thanks of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent,
and the Commander-in-Chief, were given to the troops,
through the Marquis of Wellington. In the retreat from
Burgos, which commenced in October 1812, the brigade under
Colonel Pack formed the rear-guard, and from thence to the
frontier of Portugal was very frequently in presence of the
enemy.</p>

<p>In the memorable advance of the Marquis of Wellington
into Spain, in May 1813, and the passage of the Ebro, the
brigade was in the advanced guard of the left column of
the army under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham, afterwards
Lord Lynedoch. It was in the battle of Vittoria,
fought on the 21st of June 1813, and again in the advance
of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham’s corps, in the
pursuit of the French to the Bidassoa. Shortly afterwards,
Major-General Pack, to which rank he was advanced on
the 4th of June 1813, was appointed to the <em>Highland</em>
brigade in the sixth division; the division at this time
for a short period was also under his command, and after a
forced march he arrived in time to share in the victory
gained by the Marquis of Wellington over the French
under Marshal Soult near Pampeluna, on the 30th of July
1813, in which action Major-General Pack was severely
wounded in the head. He commanded the Highland
brigade in the passage of the Bidassoa, and advance of the
British into France; in the overthrow of the enemy in his
fortified lines before Bayonne; the advance to and passage
of the Nive; the repulse of the enemy’s attack on the
British position before St. Jean de Luz; and, though not
actually engaged, he was present at the signal defeat of the
enemy’s desperate attack on Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill’s corps on the 13th of December 1813. Major-General
Pack was also in the passage of the Bidassoa, the Gave
D’Oleron, and the Pau; at the battle of Orthes on the 27th
of February 1814; in the passage of the Adour at St. Seur,
and at the battle of Toulouse on the 10th of April following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in which his brigade had nearly two-thirds of the officers
and upwards of half the privates killed and wounded.
Louis XVIII. was shortly afterwards restored to the throne
of France, Napoleon retired to the island of Elba, and the
Peninsular war terminated.</p>

<p>In 1813 Major-General Pack had been appointed a
Knight Commander of the Portuguese Order of the Tower
and Sword, and on the 2d of January 1815 was nominated a
Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He received
a cross and seven clasps for the following actions, at all of
which he commanded troops, and was personally engaged:
Roleia, Vimiera, Corunna, Busaco, siege of Ciudad Rodrigo,
Salamanca, Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and
Toulouse. Sir Denis Pack had received eight wounds, six
of them rather severe ones; had been frequently struck by
shot, and had several horses killed and wounded under him.</p>

<p>In March 1815 Europe was astounded by the return of
Napoleon to Paris. The allied powers, however, refused to
recognize his sovereignty, and determined on his dethronement.
A large army proceeded to Flanders under Field
Marshal the Duke of Wellington, and Major-General Sir
Denis Pack was placed in command of a brigade. The
campaign was as brief as it was glorious. On the 16th of
June, Napoleon, after having made one of his rapid movements,
attacked the Anglo-Belgian troops at Quatre Bras, in
which the fifth division under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas
Picton, of which Major-General Sir Denis Pack’s brigade
formed part, was engaged. Then followed the movement
on the 17th to Waterloo, where, on the 18th of June, was
fought that memorable battle in which the sun of Napoleon
set for ever, and the result of which gave to Europe a
lengthened period of tranquillity. These arduous conflicts
afforded Major-General Sir Denis Pack several opportunities
for distinguishing himself, and adding to his former honors.</p>

<p>Sir Denis Pack had the honor to receive the thanks of
both Houses of Parliament on six different occasions;
namely, for his conduct in the battles of Roleia and Vimiera;
for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo; and for the battles of
Salamanca, Vittoria, Orthes, and Waterloo.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January 1816 Major-General Sir Denis
Pack was appointed colonel of the York chasseurs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
corps was subsequently disbanded. On the 12th of August
1819 he was appointed lieut.-governor of Plymouth, and to
the command of the troops in the western district, and on the
9th of September 1822 he was appointed colonel of the eighty-fourth
regiment. The decease of Major-General Sir Denis
Pack occurred on the 24th of July 1823, at which period
he held the command of the troops in the western district
of Great Britain, and the lieut.-governorship of Plymouth.</p>

<hr class="r10a" />

<p>The following letter to Brigadier-General Sir Samuel
Auchmuty contains a full and satisfactory explanation of the
motives by which Lieut.-Colonel Pack was actuated in
effecting his escape, as alluded to in the foregoing memoir.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“Monte Video, 27th February 1807.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“Anxious to be immediately employed in the service of
my country, I take the liberty of stating the circumstances
which led me to make my escape from the enemy, trusting
my conduct on the occasion will meet with your sanction,
and that you will be pleased to take my wishes into consideration.</p>

<p>“The following, I believe, will be found a correct statement
of the transaction.</p>

<p>“Immediately after the surrender of the fort of Buenos
Ayres, on the 12th of August last, I understood from
Brigadier-General Beresford that the conditions verbally
agreed to between him and Colonel Liniers were, that the
British troops were to be considered as prisoners of war,
but to be immediately embarked for England or the Cape
and to be exchanged for those Spanish prisoners made on
the British possessing themselves of Buenos Ayres. On
the 13th, in the morning, Colonel Liniers despatched a
Spanish officer to Sir Home Popham, with a letter from
General Beresford, to send the British transports back for
the purpose of immediately carrying the treaty into execution,
and a few days afterwards I was present when
Colonel Liniers unequivocally affixed his name to the
capitulation containing the above condition.</p>

<p>“After the return of the transports, various delays took
place; and, I believe, it was on the 26th that Colonel
Liniers informed General Beresford, in presence of Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Tolly of the <span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment and Captain Arbuthnot,
the general’s aide-de-camp, (from all of whom I
learned it,) that he regretted to inform him of its having
been resolved, in spite of his efforts, not to embark the
British troops, and at the same time, declaring <em>his</em> (<em>Colonel
Liniers’</em>) abhorrence of such a breach of faith, and offering
to second General Beresford’s remonstrance on the occasion.
On the 27th, in the evening, I heard that Colonel
Liniers’ aide-de-camp had waited on General Beresford,
stating it to be the colonel’s intention to carry the treaty
into execution by privately embarking the men, and requesting
the general would, for that purpose, order the
British transports to a particular place.</p>

<p>“However, on the 31st of August or the 1st of September,
it was finally announced to General Beresford, in a letter
printed and made public, that our surrender was at discretion,
and that it was the determination of the then
government of Buenos Ayres that the British troops
should be sent to the interior, and the officers, on their
parole, to Europe.</p>

<p>“General Beresford, for obvious reasons, at first declined
our passing a parole; but being given to understand that
without it our persons were insecure, and it being determined
to separate the officers from the men, he (with the
concurrence of the majority of the seniors) finally acceded
to it.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding this, on the appearance of a British
force in the river, they were suddenly compelled to march,
under an armed escort, several miles into the interior, and
about two months afterwards orders were given to separate
and remove them still farther, and which, (notwithstanding
the remonstrances of the brigadier-general) were carried
into effect. In his communication at that time with
Colonel Liniers, he fully explained that we did not consider
ourselves on parole, nor did we think it binding, after
our removal in the first instance, and their refusing to
fulfil the conditions under which we had been prevailed
upon to give it.</p>

<p>“About this time the unfortunate murder of Captain
Ogilvie of the Royal Artillery and a private soldier of the
<span class="smcap">Seventy-first</span> regiment took place, when guards were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
placed at some of the quarters of the officers, professedly for
the purpose of protection, but positively with strict injunctions
most narrowly to watch us, and to take care (as the
government said in their instructions to the alcalde on
the same subject) that we did not desert. I mention this
circumstance to prove there could be no misunderstanding
on the subject; for though such language must be considered
unhandsome and illiberal under any circumstances, it surely
never could have been held to officers on their parole. On
the arrival of the news of the capture of Monte Video by
our forces, the chief magistrate of Buenos Ayres repaired to
General Beresford’s quarters, accompanied by Lieut.-Col.
Garcias, acquainting him with the necessity there was of
possessing himself with the papers of the several British
officers, prisoners, which he proceeded to do, <em>placing sentry
over them individually</em> until he effected his purpose; and
in a conversation which General Beresford had with
Lieut.-Colonel Garcias, he expressly told him that we
were not on our parole, recapitulating the explanation
made to Colonel Liniers upon the subject.</p>

<p>“Shortly after this the necessity of moving nine hundred
miles farther into the interior was communicated to us,
and we were on our journey with an armed escort, when
an opportunity offered, of which I most gladly availed
myself, to make my escape. I will not further trespass
on your time by commenting on the many circumstances
I conceive so evidently conclusive, but submit the bare
facts to your better judgment. However, I cannot debar
myself the satisfaction of acknowledging here the obligation
I am under to many individuals, and the kind and
generous treatment which I myself, as well as the British
officers in general, received from the inhabitants of the
town and country of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>“The irreparable loss that has been sustained by the fall
of the Commander of the Forces (Lieut.-General Sir
John Moore), and the severe wound which has removed
Lieut.-General Sir David Baird from his station, render
it the duty of Lieut.-General Hope to congratulate the
army upon the successful result of the action of the 16th
instant.</p>

<p>“On no occasion has the undaunted valour of British
troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a
severe and harassing march, rendered necessary by the
superiority which the enemy had acquired, and which had
materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many
disadvantages were to be encountered.</p>

<p>“These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the
troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that
whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may
employ, there is inherent in the British officers and
soldiers a bravery that knows not how to yield, that no
circumstances can appal, and that will ensure victory
when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human
means.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General has the greatest satisfaction in distinguishing
such meritorious services as came within his
observation, or have been brought to his knowledge.</p>

<p>“His acknowledgments are, in a peculiar manner, due to
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, and the brigade
under his command, consisting of the fourth, forty-second,
and fiftieth regiments, and which sustained the weight of
the attack.</p>

<p>“Major-General Manningham, with his brigade, consisting
of the Royals, the twenty-sixth and eighty-first regiments,
and Major-General Warde, with the brigade of
Guards, will also be pleased to accept his best thanks for
their steady and gallant conduct during the action.</p>

<p>“To Major-General Paget, who, by a judicious movement
of the reserve, effectually contributed to check the progress
of the enemy on the right; and to the first battalion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the fifty-second and ninety-fifth regiments, which were
thereby engaged, the greatest praise is justly due.</p>

<p>“That part of Major General Leith’s brigade which was
engaged, consisting of the fifty-ninth regiment, under the
conduct of the Major-General, also claims marked approbation.</p>

<p>“The enemy not having rendered the attack on the left
a serious one, did not afford to the troops stationed in that
quarter an opportunity of displaying that gallantry which
must have made him repent the attempt.</p>

<p>“The piquets and advanced posts, however, of the brigades
under the command of Major-Generals Hill and
Leith, and Colonel Catlin Craufurd, conducted themselves
with determined resolution, and were ably supported by
the officers commanding these brigades, and by the troops
of which they were composed.</p>

<p>“It is peculiarly incumbent upon the Lieut.-General
to notice the vigorous attack made by the second battalion
of the fourteenth regiment under Lieut.-Colonel Nicolls,
which drove the enemy out of the village, of the left of
which he had possessed himself.</p>

<p>“The exertions of Lieut.-Colonel Murray, Quartermaster-General,
and of the other officers of the General Staff,
during the action, were unremitted, and deserve every
degree of approbation.</p>

<p>“The illness of Brigadier-General Clinton, Adjutant-General,
unfortunately deprived the army of the benefit
of his services.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General hopes the loss in point of numbers
is not so considerable as might have been expected;
he laments, however, the fall of the gallant soldiers and
valuable officers who have suffered.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General knows that it is impossible, in any
language he can use, to enhance the esteem, or diminish
the regret, that the army feels with him for its late Commander.
His career has been unfortunately too limited
for his country, but has been sufficient for his own fame.
Beloved by the army, honored by his Sovereign, and
respected by his country, he has terminated a life devoted
to her service by a glorious death,&mdash;leaving his name as a
memorial, an example, and an incitement to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
shall follow him in the path of honor, and it is from his
country alone that his memory can receive the tribute
which is its due.</p>

<p class="right">“<em>Horse Guards, 1st February 1809.</em></p>

<p>“The benefits derived to an army from the example of a
distinguished Commander do not terminate at his death;
his virtues live in the recollection of his associates, and
his fame remains the strongest incentive to great and
glorious actions.</p>

<p>“In this view the Commander-in-Chief, amidst the deep
and universal regret which the death of Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore has occasioned, recals to the troops the
military career of that illustrious officer for their instruction
and imitation.</p>

<p>“Sir John Moore from his youth embraced the profession
with the feelings and sentiments of a soldier; he
felt that a perfect knowledge and an exact performance
of the humble but important duties of a subaltern officer
are the best foundations for subsequent military fame,
and his ardent mind, while it looked forward to those
brilliant achievements for which it was formed, applied
itself with energy and exemplary assiduity to the duties
of that station.</p>

<p>“In the school of regimental duty he obtained that
correct knowledge of his profession so essential to the
proper direction of the gallant spirit of the soldier, and
he was enabled to establish a characteristic order and
regularity of conduct, because the troops found in their
leader a striking example of the discipline which he enforced
on others.</p>

<p>“Having risen to command, he signalised his name in
the West Indies, in Holland, and in Egypt. The unremitting
attention with which he devoted himself to the
duties of every branch of his profession obtained him
the confidence of Sir Ralph Abercromby, and he became
the companion in arms of that illustrious officer, who
fell at the head of his victorious troops in an action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
which maintained our national superiority over the arms
of France.</p>

<p>“Thus Sir John Moore at an early period obtained,
with general approbation, that conspicuous station in
which he gloriously terminated his useful and honorable
life.</p>

<p>“In a military character obtained amidst the dangers of
climate, the privations incident to service, and the sufferings
of repeated wounds, it is difficult to select any one
point as a preferable subject for praise; it exhibits, however,
one feature so particularly characteristic of the man,
and so important to the best interests of the service, that
the Commander-in-Chief is pleased to mark it with his
peculiar approbation&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The life of SIR JOHN MOORE was spent among
the troops.</span></p>

<p>“During the season of repose his time was devoted to
the care and instruction of the officer and soldier; in war
he courted service in every quarter of the globe. Regardless
of personal consideration, he esteemed that to which
his country called him <em>the post of honor</em>, and by his
undaunted spirit and unconquerable perseverance he
pointed the way to victory.</p>

<p>“His country, the object of his latest solicitude, will
rear a monument to his lamented memory, and the Commander-in-Chief
feels he is paying the best tribute to
his fame by thus holding him forth as an <span class="fs70">EXAMPLE</span> to the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
